In the case of coronavirus, transportation is still very possible; worst case you're sending down people in hazmat suits (or similar). It's not like the trucks can't move.In the case of eBay and the like, since you're buying/selling over the Internet, nobody's taking any precautions against spreading the disease via packaging anyway so it's not like the sellers are taking any greater risk to move product. It comes down to a bare supply/demand equation at that point.Admittedly, the buyers are just as ""bad"" as the sellers since they eventually cave in to the demands of the sellers, which moves the market price upward. If nobody pays the ""gouge"" prices, the problem is essentially solved. Eventually prices have to return to normal levels. You might complain, ""but if prices go down, supply will run out/nobody will have incentive to move product!"". But again, this is ridiculous. If I can sell you hand sanitizer for $.99 for a small bottle yesterday, why must I sell it to you for $20 now? As the seller, my cost basis hasn't necessarily gone up (unless it eventually becomes a raw-material problem). At that point all you get are shortages if demand can't keep up. Stuff like disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer are relatively cheap, so supply will track upwards, and pretty quickly. Shortages aren't really a bad thing. Moving prices upwards drastically to maintain supply isn't really helpful since, beyond a certain price point, nobody will have access to that supply anyway. May as well have none if you can't/won't pay the gouge prices anyway.Price gouging in the case of disaster is never about free markets, supply/demand, incentivizing the movement of scarce items, and so forth.

Expect the overall mortality rate to fall as it reaches countries more prepared for it, but also for mortality rate to vary between countries according to *how well* they prepare and respond, and other local factors.For example Germany reported its first case on January 18, Italy on January 30; this may not reflect the precise arrival of the virus in either of those countries, but in any event the progress of the diseases has gone dramatically different in each of those countries. Italy now has 3858 cases and 148 deaths for a 3.8% death rate so far, with 85% of cases still active. Germany, with about 1/3 more population, has had only 578 cases with zero fatalities, but with 98% of cases still active.The differences in recovery rate and earlier detection may well be due to better testing in Germany, where the WHO tests was originally developed.

I mostly can't stand watching it, but I turn on the TV when I'm eating and the rest of the cable channels are so gawdawful that I often wind up trying CNN in desperation. This has the side effect of giving me a kind of random sample of CNN content, and most of the time when I sample CNN, what I see is tripe. The ads are actually the best part of it, the so-called news content is scattered around the middle, and the worst of the tripe is the endless ads for CNN itself.CNN wouldn't need so many ads telling me about CNN's credibility if CNN had the credibility in the first place.

What he decided to do is design a special suit that he would ultimately be buried in which had numerous deep pockets. He made arrangements that upon his death, his estate should be sold and converted into gold, and the gold bars placed in the pockets of the suit so that he would be buried with his wealth.

He then finds that he's materialized at the entrance to heaven, with St. Peter standing there beside the gates. He's delighted to discover that he's made it here, but he looks down to see what he is wearing. It turns out that he's wearing the special suit that he wanted to be buried in.

For low income workers who are often living paycheck to paycheck, assuming they even live in a state with mandatory paid sick time (Michigan literally just implemented it last year and the implementation is shitty), they're highly unlikely to have enough to cover the sometimes two weeks the CDC is suggesting this may require. People can't just fucking take two weeks off like it's nothing, especially when taking unpaid time off means not eating or paying bills. If someone's forced to choose between protecting their own interest in being able to continue surviving versus maybe spreading flu++ to other people at work, it's pretty fucking obvious what they're going to do. This is exacerbated by the abysmal prevention education going on. Rather than teaching people how to make their own face masks with household items and how to properly wear them and how to properly dispose of them without touching the exposed parts, something which could significant mitigate the impact of people going into work while sick anyway (which is going to happen), the CDC would rather screech about supply chain issues and don't buy masks because then the hospitals can't get them. While it's true the supply of face masks is low due to high demand and that hospitals need to be prioritized, you can literally make your own face masks at home, something which other countries are emphasizing in their literature. Moreover, the correct response to supply issues would be to pay off some businesses to start manufacturing them in greater numbers -- something which several other countries have already done but the US government doesn't think is necessary. The idea that we can contain it with these half-assed measures is laughable. I heard estimates that 30-70% of people will get this. I'm going to lean toward the 70% side. The kinds of people with the most potential to expose others (e.g. people like food services workers) are the exact people who lack the means to keep themselves from exposing other people, and the government reaction to the crisis is a fucking joke.

Maybe four or more, if somebody comes down with it. They won't be able to go out and buy food, so they better have some on hand. Also water (in case there's a power failure or contamination), toilet paper, paper towels, etc. If you'd run out in two to four weeks you'd better stock up now, while you can.Costco has name brand canned food by the box for cheap.

It's the regular stuff you'd normally use, so eat it over a couple years (and rotate in more) and it won't go to waste. Further: when there was a run on bottled water in their Fremont store (a silicon valley town) they brought in five truckloads - and didn't hike the price. Good place to stock up.Can't count on delivery from outside: Delivery folks might be down or busy with other quarantined. Also: That nursing home in Washington with all the cases is in Kirkland: The founding city of Costco (notice the name of their store brand?)

Having some emergency supplies is recommended.So when a lot of people realize, all at once, that having more supplies is a good idea, they buy a bunch more than the regular stores have on hand.

When you consider unknown cases, the range is between ~0.6% and 3.4% based on the assumption that 0-80% of cases are unknown.Indeed, but only when you consider that those 0-80% are still in the asymptomatic incubation stage of the infection. There's nothing to say that many of those 80% won't end up becoming a fatal statistic themselves.Doing dumb multiplication while ignoring the time varying nature of viruses is just silly, and guess what, the 3.4% figure actually takes into account some of what you considered since dumb multiplication actually comes out closer to 6%",thegarbz,2,0,0,0,0
59798800,126665774,"I like your 0.6%-number.If you take the current complete numbers (including 2020-03-04) of all countries, you find the 0.6% mortality rate in one of the biggest samples - South Korea.There are other Countries with even lower death rates (0% in Germany), but with only a much smaller sample of patients, deaths and recoveries.Beside bad luck (outbreak in residence for older people) or differently aggressive strains of virus, there are also other factors to this 'mortality rate'.Lets have a look at those two factors:a.) thorough testing of many, many people (better basic set) andb.) priority to early and good care for infected people (direct lowering of mortality rate, the ""early"" part being connected to a.).a.), the basic set:Let's assume that South Korea does exceptionally well at a.), getting the basic set right(er). We then have to accept that 0.6% as a more realistic value than that of other countries. I find other numbers supporting that: since a whole month, the number of known corona deaths and recoveries in South Korea lags a quite stable two weeks behind the number of all known cases.In more chaotic countries (Iran, Italy), the number of known deaths and recoveries lags behind only a few days to one week, oscilating (Iran) or slowly increasing (Italy).Iran and Italy seem to find their cases later than South Korea, which supports the assumption that South Korea does well at a.).Interestingly, in Mainland China and thus worldwide, this lag is even bigger, 3 weeks (US: going down from 3 to 2 weeks). So, the South Koreans could be bad at detecting their deaths and recoveries despite their extensive testing, or China and the world still has to catch up with their basic set.b.), the care for patients:It may benefit the patients, if a country has a culture of strictly sticking to facts and of preferring facts over policy.Evaluating the death rates at a random time (end of day 2020-03-04) in a subjectively chosen set ofcountries (but each with > 150 confirmed cases), we get:mortality country (known basic set)7.19% US (153)3.46% Italy (3098)3.17% Mainland China (80271)3.15% Iran (2922)1.40% France (285)0.62% South Korea (5621)0.00% Germany (262)",lipinger,1,0,0,0,0

A country which imposed quarantine measures on the majority of their infected population which may have restricted their access to healthcare. The Chinese response has effectively been to let the virus burn itself out. That implies that 3.4% is mortality rate when denied healthcare and the rate would end up lower in areas with better health systems or better access to care. It's more likely to be a worst case figure with most nations seeing mortality rates much lower.Do keep in mind that as of March 3rd the number of cases worldwide were 80,304 cases with 2,946 fatalities in China (3.6%) with 10,566 cases in the rest of the world amounting to 166 deaths (1.5%). The Hubei region of China, where the toughest quarantine measures were imposed, has seen 67,217 cases with 2,834 deaths (4.2%) while the rest of China accounts for 13,087 cases with 112 deaths (0.8%). https://www.who.int/emergencie...

59796448,126573552,"Alternatively, I could say you're full of shit by reporting the incorrect figures for the US (the CDC had 80 cases 9 deaths on their website for 11.2%). You can look at the WHO reports I linked to. They're daily so obviously the March 3rd WHO report doesn't contain new cases that were identified prior to the data being collected for the report. Realistically, I'll just say that you're making spurious conclusions on less than 100 cases. For a nation the size of the US (327.2 million)you would need 9,604 cases to have a 1% margin of error. 80 cases, like the CDC reports, is a 11% margin of error and since most of those cases probably haven't ran their course we're probably talking somewhere around a 15% margin of error (43 cases). The US mortality rate is obviously unreliable as the margin of error says we could have anything from a 0.2% to a 22.2% for the 11% margin of error to less than 0.1% to 26.2% for the 15% margin of error.All of that? It's there to show how pointless and dumb it is to make any predictions based on what the US has experienced.The simple fact is that China had implemented quarantine protocols across Hubei and when dealing with a large number of disease cases quarantine almost certainly means zero medical care. This is not an expectation we would have across most countries unless the disease gets out of control.As far as nations go, South Korea (4,812 / 28 / 0.5%), Italy (2,036 / 52 / 2.5%), and Iran (1,501 66 / 4.3%) are the only other countries to lower the margin of error. Korea and Italy are around a 2% margin of error while Iran is around 3%. The population outside of Hubei (0.8%) is enough cases to have a 1% margin of error. 1.8%, if you would kindly note, is within the margin of error of those individual countries I listed.Further, we don't have data on the number of undocumented cases.

59794252,126573552,"There have been numerous studies with exhaustive testing of subpopulations (workers, apartment blocks, healthcare workers) in China. This ist not just about dividing rough numbers found on the Internet.Also this isn't all that easy. Once the virus is in the wild infections multiply exponentially (on average doubling every 6.4 days). This means that at any given point in time there are much more infected people who have been infected only for a short time than those who already have been infected for longer. Death occurs usually in the third week after infection though. This causes the numbers of the dying to be deceptively small compared to the total number of the infected as long as the virus is still spreading through the population. Those who will die still die a week or two or three later, but until then there are 2, 4 or 8 times as many freshly infected than before.Your ""iceberg"" theory (which assumes that the death rate is smaller than it appears to be because there are lots of undetected infections) has been thoroughly debunked meanwhile. Just like the ""only Chinese die from it"" one before.The death rate is not just the number of those who have died compared to the known infected but it is also not just the number of those who have died compared to all infected at any point in time. It's the percentage of those who will die from the infection compared to all infected. Death lags infection by two or three weeks and as long as the number of the freshly infected are still rising fast you will underestimate the percentage of the dying.So you really need to look at exhaustively tested subpopulations so you can find all infected among them and then look at how many of them will die from the infection over time. Only this will give you the true mortality rate.And of course this will change a lot with treatment. If you can supply intensive care including artificial ventilation there will be much fewer deaths than otherwise. Once all your ICUs are swamped and you can just put the severely ill down on stretchers in a stadium, well. Even in the less severe cases hospital care makes a difference, like antibiotics to avoid secondary infections.",joh,5,0,1,0,0

But right now, today, on this day, Monday, if you look at the country as a whole, the risk is low. That is not convincing me. First: ""imagine"" ? Second: ""the risk"" is ""how is it going to develop?"" In my book ""low"" is something like ""arithemtic growth with coefficient below 1/2"" and ""high"" is, for example, ""exponential growth"".

There are indications that the death rate is lower when people are aware at the start it could be corona-19, but this is largely an untested unknown in most of the world and will remain so. The Spanish flu in 1918-1920 had a fatality rate of 2-3% as well, and the worldwide death count was 20 to 100 million. U.S. deaths were 500,000 to 650,000. Granted WWI had stressed a lot of the world leading up to it. I read that it most of those were not the young and old, because it was thought that older people had possibly acquired some immunity from a previous flu. So it hit largely the working age people. But yes, a 3% fatality rate is very bad news. At some point, we may have a vaccination. Whether that will be available in time is anybodies guess. China took the step of shutting down their economy to stop it. A lot of the rest of the world won't do that because they don't have a government like China. It may be contained world wide, or it may spread far and wide. But if the fatality rate doesn't drop, yes it is a big deal. Read the Wikipedia article on the Spanish Flu.

They are the product of their environment.If someone grew up in a house where they were mocked for reading (probably because their parents can't read very well and are insecure about it) you can't really be surprised when they grow up and can't understand a tax form and then end up in jail for not doing their taxes properly. Instead of just throwing them in a hole for a few years why not set a goal of ""you can't leave until we're confident that you understand how to read and how taxes work"" and then push them at it.I've plucked that example out of thin air but I imagine there's a lot of people who resort to stealing etc because they don't know how else to pay their bills and having a job does not mean you can make ends meet in a lot of Western countries.

59790438,126464520,"The cuts in health spending in recent history happened predominantly under Obama [aaas.org] (in inflation-adjusted dollars). The biggest increases in recent history were under Bush, from 2001-2004. Then gradually decreased to 2008. Under Obama, health spending held steady for a few years, then continued to decline, until 2016 when it ticked up slightly. Under Trump these increases have continued. Although funding for specific programs may have been cut, overall funding has increased. If you scroll further down the AAAS link, you can see the budget changes specifically for the CDC from 2018 to 2019. Spending on Influenza and Influenza planning and response, HIV prevention and research, and infectious diseases and the opioid epidemic were actually increased. The cuts mostly fell in antibiotics resistance research, prevention research centers, and environmental health. I'm not knowledgeable enough about these departs to say with certainty, but based on the names it sounds like funding for the programs which would've been involved containing this coronavirus from spreading, were all increased. (The prevention research centers [cdc.gov] deal with more mundane disease threats, not pandemics.) Note that the ""2020 budget"" is markedly lower because it's a budget request, not the actual budget. For those who don't know how the U.S. Federal budgeting process works, the President only requests a budget. Congress is the one who actually makes the budget, and they can completely ignore the President's request if they wish (and they frequently do). The President then signs or vetoes the budget Congress gives him. That's why I listed budget changes in the first paragraph as ""under"" a certain President, rather than attributing it to the President. Trump has been requesting lowball amounts almost across the board [aaas.org].

If anything, the feeling is that the numbers are fudged downwards - there could be a lot more sick or dead, and China is playing it down (they don't want to tank their trade). The data out of Iran is, if anything, worse on the trustworthiness scale. So we've got some cases in Italy, kind of our first chance to get hard numbers about anything, and we're using the poor suckers on the cruise ships as contained experiments to see how contagious (early data seems like the answer is ""very"") and deadly (still assessing outcomes) it is.

59788462,126433884,"The main thing to keep in mind is that the incubation period is two weeks, during which time you are infectious but not obviously sick. If there is community spread going on in the west coast, then the cases we are seeing now more or less represent the situation 2 weeks ago. These first few visible community-acquired cases are going to be some of the first people to get sick that way, and it will have been spreading unchecked for 2 weeks now that we're seeing the first cases. 2 weeks from now we'll find out how far it had spread as of right now, but it'll have had another 2 weeks to spread. Of course, this will happen continuously so we'll see a slow but exponential increase in the number of community-acquired cases, which we won't be able to halt because they already happened.Furthermore, since there's no travel restrictions it's much more likely to jump to other parts of the country. There's far more interstate travel than international travel in the US. So, you aren't necessarily safe just because you aren't living on the west coast. Everywhere it spreads to, the virus is going to have a 2 week head start before we start seeing cases.There are a few small caveats to this, if we were testing our population more extensively then we could theoretically catch more cases in the incubation period, and thus find out where it's spreading before 2 weeks has elapsed. That said, earlier stories on Slashdot have suggested that our testing programs are way behind the curve right now. More importantly, it's statistically unlikely for us to find the virus until it's already pretty prevalent in the population. If 40 people have it in California, then you'd have to test 1 million people in California at random to have any sort of chance of testing one of those 40 people, and it's really hard to really test people at random. Plus, that one person we might find will ""just be one case"", and not elicit as much alarm as multiple cases, even though there are 40 cases out there. Therefore, testing probably won't see the virus until there are many hundreds or thousands of people already infected (1000 people is 0.0025% of California's population, or about 1-in-400). So, testing will be useful to health authorities to find out where the community spread has become critical, and thus where it is justified to start quarantines to prevent the outbreak from widening, but it won't be so useful for stopping the spread around the US.Also, as you pointed out, there's a false positive rate for any test, so massive testing of the population is only useful once the number of real cases rises above the noise of false positives. That said, these community acquired cases are probably people getting sick and coming to the hospital, as opposed to people being found by screening programs, since after all we were hardly doing any screening before community-acquired cases started popping up.More importantly, the test for Coronavirus is especially accurate because they're looking directly for the virus's genes (a PCR assay, they are looking directly for the DNA (RNA?) pattern of the virus), so that makes false positives especially unlikely as you basically have to have Coronavirus's genetic sequence floating around inside of you for the test to be positive (unless someone really drops the ball on performing the test). I'm also pretty sure the health authorities are waiting until they're very confident to make an announcement, as unlike the media they don't have an incentive to get the news out ASAP. So, now that there's several known community-acquired cases, you can be pretty sure that Coronavirus has reached the US and is spreading through the community.One more important caveat here is that spring and summer are swiftly approaching, and the warmer weather and increasing solar radiation may blunt the spread of the virus. Coronavirus spreads a lot like the flu, and the same factors that reduce the spread of the flu in the summer will likely reduce the spread of Coronavirus. That said, summer alone won't stop Coronavirus enti",urusan,5,0,0,1,0

59787904,126378510,"You have a seriously warped view of what ""evolution"" is. Let me paint you a few scenarios.First, consider what would happen if a nearby star went supernova. All life on earth would die. And with that, evolution on Earth would be over. Biological lives are ending, and that isn't evolution.Next, consider certain single cell organisms with no natural lifespan. They are effectively immortal. They procreate by splitting. Which half is the original? You don't know, no one knows, there is, in fact, no logical way to tell. That single celled organism could, in fact, be the very same cell that first existed billions of years ago. Evolution works on populations, not individuals.Evolution does not eliminate lives. Circumstances do. As circumstances change, different things become advantageous or disadvantageous. Thorns, for example, are an advantage when there are large grazing mammals around. But transplant that same species to a new volcanic island, where there are no grazing mammals, and thorns are a disadvantage (they cost resources to make, while providing no benefit.) The thorns will not be selected for, and random mutations that get rid of thorns will provide the organism with better fitness for the current environment.Thus, evolution, as a theory, provides us with ideas about what we might see when we visit new places. And it has proven to provide good, accurate estimates. We do not, in fact, find thorny plants where there are no grazers, just as the theory predicts.Evolution isn't about dying, it is about procreating. As I mentioned, evolution works even on single celled organisms that never die. Random mutations still happen, circumstances change, and the organism becomes more, or less able to create offspring that can themselves reproduce. If the organism becomes unable to produce viable offspring, evolution essentially stops. By viable, I mean, capable of reproducing themselves. For example, Horse and donkeys can mate and produce offspring, but that offspring, the Mule or Hinny, can not reproduce. It is sterile.It seems you are focusing on the phrase ""survival of the fittest"" without understanding what it really means.

Evolution is just a change in heritable characteristics of biological populations over time. It doesn't even require death to function. Many single cell organisms are effectively immortal. Death itself evolved from immortality.Evolution isn't a religion. I gain nothing from convincing you it is a useful theory that helps explain the patterns we see in biological populations and fossils. So, my friend, I am not proposing you care about it. The theory of evolution gains nothing from those who ""care"" about it, and those who do not ""care"" about it subtract nothing from it.Let me paraphrase your argument.

It provides no spiritual guidance, no sense of belonging or being a part of something greater than yourself. Well, it isn't supposed to. That is not its purpose.

Maybe you're familiar with it?1 Judge not, that ye be not judged.2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?5 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.Hope that helps you on your spiritual journey. Remember, God works in mysterious ways. Perhaps I am the wake up call that God is sending to you.If Mathew doesn't cut it for you, maybe try Luke, chapter 6 verses 37-42.37 Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.38 Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.39 He also told them this parable: “Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into a pit?40 The student is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully trained will be like their teacher.41 Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?42 How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye?

59786580,126378510,"""Covering pre-existing conditions makes the entire system *cease to be insurance*, it's merely making someone else pay for your problems.""This is why it's important to align on objectives. Most people, including in America but almost certainly not including you, think the objective of a funding system for healthcare should be to ensure that everyone can get the care they need, from cradle to grave -- including those who cannot pay eg tiny babies -- and affordably. (I'm sure you agree tiny babies ought not to have to pay for their healthcare, but I'm not sure how you think that should happen).The cheapest way to achieve that objective of affordable care for all is to create a *risk pool* covering that entire population, from cradle to grave, with cover provided for a very wide range of interventions. NB, a risk pool is not the same thing as an insurance model.Attempts to de-risk the risk pool in some way -- to move towards an insurance model, in other words -- always cost more money overall, and while they can lower the costs for some participants, they also always ensure that some people will not get all the care they need, from cradle to grave, affordably. Why do they always cost more money overall? Because you lose economies of scale, increase admin costs, and move attention away from bearing down on provider costs. Why do they also always ensure some people won't get the care they need, affordably? Because insurance only covers defined risks for a defined beneficiary for a defined period of time, and the purpose of de-risking the pool is to push some risks from covered to not covered: to ensure that some people have a condition or treatment that's not covered, or have become uncovered (eg through divorce or change of employer), or have an illness that started at the wrong time. The pool isn't de-risked unless the risk has been pushed from the pool to some of the participants (or ex-participants). This is why European Bismarckian (insurer-based) systems have higher costs-of-care and lower coverage rates than Beveridgean systems (tax-funded), and it's also why they're regulated to ensure consumer costs are lower and coverage rates are higher than market forces alone would dictate.I don't know what your objective is.At a guess, based on what you've said so far, you're OK to be sharing the costs of care with others (eg you're OK with insurance per se, despite its inherently collectivist nature) -- but you want to have some people and some risks excluded by the insurer to bring down your own costs of care. This appears to include people with pre-existing conditions (""making someone else pay for your problems""), young pregnant women (""pre-natal counselling""), people transitioning (""gender reassignment surgery"") and no doubt a host of other people and risks. So I'd be curious to understand what your objective is in relation to those excluded people? Maybe you don't have one, and you're truly indifferent if your preferred system meant a pregnant woman died at home alone because she couldn't get insurance to cover the costs of having a baby and couldn't afford the costs out-of-pocket. As I said, I'd be curious to know your objective in relation to all excluded people, including but not limited to pregnant women.A final comment: excluding young women from your insurance is ultimately going to drive up your own insurance costs considerably. A pool that includes men in their 50s but excludes women in their 20s and 30s will have much higher costs-of-care overall, because you're making the case-mix much more costly due to higher prevalence of cancer, CVD, diabetes etc among 50-something men cf 20/30-something women.

The same goes for anti-vaxxing there's also a very large emotional component in there. You rightly called it 'suspicion' already, which then is turned into fear with spotty information, misinformation, and a huge portion of fear of the unknown and unfamiliar. The Germans here have a saying that translates to: What the *peasant doesn't know, he won't eat. The 'eat' is used in the figurative sense. This refers to a catch-22 situation where the unknown isn't even given a 'taste' so I can never be known and will be rejected continually. It also appeals to confirmation bias for the case when something is 'tasted' it's only tested for the confirmation of the preconceived notions and not also for evidence to the contrary or other aspects. People like to be right and don't like to be confronted with failure.

59782244,126230844,"There is no general purpose lab test for viral infections. Bacteria you can culture in a petri dish then count and identify them. You can even look at them under a microscope. A virus is too small to see so you can't even confirm one is present without a species-specific molecular biology test.To develop that test you need concentrated samples of the virus free from the stew of chemicals you find in the human body. A virus doesn't reproduce outside of a host cell so that's tricky. You have to grow them in a compatible cell culture (if you can find one), then either produce antigens (for immunoassays like ELISA) or species-specific DNA-cleaving primers for PCR (polymerase chain reaction). For a virus that is highly infectious you have to do all this in a special lab using extra precautions [wikipedia.org].The cases of novel pathogens like COVID-19 are identified is by clinical observation and Occam's razor: this person has the same *symptoms* as a whole bunch of other patients right now, they test negative for bacterial infections or known viruses, so we'll assume they all have the same new virus.That's the way COVID-19 is still mostly diagnosed today: old-fashioned, seat-of-the-pants doctoring. That involves judgment calls. People get sick with unknown viruses all the time, viruses with similar symptoms. And not everyone with COVID-19 develops all the same symptoms.

The problem for Trump is Haley is ambitious and sees herself as a potential 2024 candidate, trading on *just enough* Trump exposure to make a claim to Trump's base but just enough distance to not be tainted, plus being a female candidate, something Republicans will probably favor in a bid to keep the White House after Trump.The TL;DR is that Haley would work as a replacement, but has ambitions that make her loyalty questionable.",LostMyAccount,2,0,0,0,0

May take guns to get food, grow food or rely on handouts or die after 6 weeks.Group B has no cans of food and no guns. Runs out of food after 1 week. Relies on handouts first, may grow food or die after 3 weeks.The logical comparison is that group A is more resilient, since short crises are vastly more likely than long crises.Also logical: by the time group A runs out of food, there will be nothing more to steal from group B, so B has nothing to worry about. A's may only steal from some fellow A's that have food left, but who are also armed, so it's hardly possible to just take it. Group B has nothing to worry about, group A's with food left were smart to own guns to protect themselves.Since food cans and guns are easily accessible and cheap, if some compromises are accepted (pawn shop guns, no fancy stuff), the most logical conclusion would be to become part of group A.

Not partial to the bill or that hospital's MCR, not sure if that would have saved money or not. Still, the proper response is to stay home, call in to your hospital and discuss your symptoms. There's no reason to go to the hospital unless you need hospitalization, which is about 5% of the cases of the corona virus. If you have body aches, sore throat, and other sympoms of the flu, then you have the regular flu. If you have fever, cough, and trouble breathing, and not the others, then you have the corona virus.

The study he quoted there showed that 25% of US adults don't have health insurance for at least part of the year (it's about 12% who don't have it for the whole year), then they multipled 25% by the 200 million adults, so 50 million didn't have full-year coverage and 150 million DID have full-year coverage. Sanders then makes the frankly bonkers math conclusion that you have to minus the 50 million from the 150 million and that's the number of workers who ""lose"" health insurance ""every year"".Now, I like Sanders more than any other candidate you got going. But you gotta be as bad as a Trumpist if you start twisting reality to fit whatever comes out of your candidates mouth no matter how silly it is.",Cipheron,2,0,0,0,0
59780694,126078850,"So, Sanders misrepresents data to make a populist case. That's just a fact.Sanders claimed that out of 150 million workers, 50 million will lose coverage this year. That's 1/3 full-time workers doomed to lose coverage. That's using fear to get himself elected.The actual figure is that there are about 175 million people on coverage, but out of that, 25 million don't have coverage the whole year. But that includes both people who gained coverage, or lost coverage in that year, and the total number of people on coverage doesn't really change much year-to-year, so the number of people who will lose coverage this year is really around 12.5 million out of about ~162.5 million who started the year with coverage. So the number of people who will lose coverage who had it at the start of the year ISN'T the 1-in-3 figure given by Sanders, it's really about 1-in-13.",Cipheron,2,0,0,0,0

If even one voter is improperly denied the vote then that is a much worse crime than if someone manages to vote improperly. Stop putting hurdles in the way of voting.Voting should also be allowed in a district if the voter has a reasonable claim to be living in that district - no more refusing to allow students to vote merely because they're in the college town for less than 12 months out of the year.

Buses and vans do legally arrive at polling places all the time, because people volunteer to bring in voters who can't easily travel to voting places. And of course this hypervigilant self appointed guardian has no idea who's illegal or not. But after these reports there are always some politicians who stand up and demand voter ids or crackdowns. Even Trump who refuses to believe he might have lost the popular vote followed the same script to rant about rampant voter fraud (of course he was just repeating a fake story, but listeners who love Trump probably assumed he had evidence and were convinced it was true).Easier ways to influence an election are to try and prevent entire classes of voters from casting votes. From a government report on the 2000 Election in Florida (https://www.usccr.gov/pubs/vote2000/report/exesum.htm):The purge system in Florida proceeded on the premise of guilty until proven innocent. In 1998, the Florida legislature enacted a statute that required the Division of Elections to contract with a private entity to purge its voter file of deceased persons, duplicate registrants, individuals declared mentally incompetent, and convicted felons without civil rights restoration, i.e., remove ineligible voter registrants from voter registration rolls. This purge process became known as list maintenance. Once on the list, the process places the burden on the eligible voter to justify remaining on the voter rolls. The ubiquitous errors and dearth of effective controls in the state’s list maintenance system resulted in the exclusion of voters lawfully entitled and properly registered to vote.African American voters were placed on purge lists more often and more erroneously than Hispanic or white voters. For instance, in the state’s largest county, Miami-Dade, more than 65 percent of the names on the purge list were African Americans, who represented only 20.4 percent of the population. Hispanics were 57.4 percent of the population, but only 16.6 percent of the purge list; whites were 77.6 percent of the population but 17.6 percent of those purged.",Darinbob,2,0,0,0,0

In terms of the death rate, the Diamond Princess situation may overstate it. Cruise passengers tend to skew towards the much older (hell, many passengers treat it as an old folks home), and there are (usually) very few children. But we don't know what the precise demographics were on the Diamond Princess. And of course, if you're particularly vulnerable - you've just had some kind of medical treatment that would undermine your immune system, for example, you probably won't go on a cruise. And, of course, it hasn't played out yet, it's 691 infections so far, and 4 deaths so far. In terms of the infection rate, while there were screw ups, after the first day or two of it becoming common knowledge there were infected passengers in board, all passengers were confined to their cabins, a somewhat extreme form of quarantine. So my guess is that the infection rate is much lower than it'll pose across society as a whole. My guess is that the number of world wide infections is probably in excess of 10x of the officially announced number, simply because most people with it probably think they have a cold, or don't want to go to the doctor because it's expensive.

Family members buying a lot for setting up a home rather than anything holiday related along the way with cash. Less of that always on smartphone use. The state and city govs in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana start to see a lot more cash and spending. A jump in worker numbers in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana for projects like power, solar, wells, dams. If needed gov permit numbers change. A lot of good paying local work for cash and no gossip. 3. Near to last warning is the international flow of different nations embassy staff out of the USA. A lot of embassy staff on holiday, having to go home for some reason... Their own citizens and students returning home and accepting the loss of money invested in the USA. Hushed conversations among their own citizens and embassy staff. US workers at other nations embassy buildings, homes getting invited for a chat resulting in very unexpected and large payments, gifts for work done. The strange interest in embassy staff only for their nations own citizens and not having time to get US tourism to their nation. Shift changes as embassy workers with normal jobs suddenly get very busy with computers, documents, tech ... computers stop been used and are removed.. 4. Final warnings. US mil staff at a lower rank and less of a security clearance finally start to notice their shift work is all about on site security and they can always get a great park every shift. The much smarter people they once worked with/for are all on holiday. They start to look to buy up food, water, masks.",AHuxley,1,0,0,0,0

59775604,126065646,"From link above, pre-Coronavirus: Hand-washing takes less than half a minute, yet an estimated 97% of people do it wrong. Here's how long you should wash your hands to prevent getting sick from harmful bacteria. How long you should wash your hands ""It's recommended that you wash your hands for the amount of time it takes to sing 'Happy Birthday' twice — about 20 seconds,"" says family physician Dr. Sarah Borwein, MD. ""Twenty seconds has been shown to be the minimum amount of time it takes to really remove germs."" If you don't wash long enough, even with soap, it could backfire. ""Chances are that you are not effectively removing all the disease-causing germs that are lurking on them,"" Borwein tells Insider. On the flip side, washing for too long can cause more problems, especially if you are using harsh soap. ""It can result in skin that is dry, cracked or even bleeds,"" Borwein says. ""This interrupts the barrier protective function of the skin and allows germs to enter the body."" Washing your hands with cold or lukewarm water A common misconception is that hot water is best to clean your hands. ""Many people believe that hotter water is better, but in fact, for the purposes of removing germs, there is no good evidence that water temperature matters,"" Borwein says. ""Using hot water can dry the hands out and lead to skin damage, so the recommendation is to use cold or warm water."" As for the best method to effectively wash your hands, Borwein encourages rubbing your hands together ""vigorously"", and covering all surfaces: the back of the hands, wrists, between the fingers, and under fingernails where grime gets stuck. Plus, if you actually scrub all the right surfaces, hitting that 20-second mark should be easy. Anti-bacterial soap has no added benefits There are no added benefits to using anti-bacterial soap versus the plain kind, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In fact, Borwein warns that it's not even equally effective as an old-fashioned hand washing. ""Soap and water is actually the best way to remove germs from the hands. Hand sanitizer is a good alternative when soap and water is not readily available, or in some situations like hospitals and clinics, where you have to wash your hands a great many times per day and sometimes that isn't realistic."" Unlike washing hands with soap and water, sanitizer doesn't remove all harmful germs on your hands. ""For example, Norovirus [which causes vomiting and diarrhea] is not effectively killed by hand sanitizer,"" Borwein tells Insider. Plus, sanitizer won't work as effectively on visibly filthy hands because it won't remove dirt as easily. So make sure to always wash after doing dirty work like taking out the trash, outdoor activities, or handling greasy items. ""If using alcohol sanitizer, it should contain at least 60% alcohol,"" Borwein says. ""And you should use enough — don't be stingy with it. A rough size guide is a dime-size amount.""",Iwastheone,5,0,1,0,0

59776262,126065646,"It is likely that the mortality rate is much higher, and here's why. The 2% comes from dividing the number of dead by the number that have been infected. The problem is that we are still so early on in this that not even half of those infected have recovered yet. In other words, we haven't given them enough time to die from the virus yet to increase the mortality rate.If you take the number of recovered plus the number of deaths (in other words, the total of those infected for whom we know the outcome of), and take the deaths as a percentage of that, you get a mortality rate of 7.26%. It's possible that some of those infected have recovered, but perhaps not counted as recovered (it's easier to track dead bodies than people that got better and disappeared), so more than likely the reality lies somewhere in the middle. I'm guessing 4-5%. Only time will tell, and more accurate reporting from countries like South Korea, Italy, etc that I assume will have more complete numbers.At this moment, the numbers I'm using for above are:Total Confirmed Infected: 83,342Total Recovered: 36,488Total Still Sick: 46,854 (extrapolated from the above two numbers)Total Deaths: 2,856Total Deaths + Total Recovered = 39,344 individuals for which we know the outcome of (either recovered or died)2,856 / 39,344 = 0.0726 or 7.26%Also, another concerning bit of information is the Japanese woman who tested positive in January, recovered, and is now testing positive again.

Worked for me.Though, I wouldn't count on it necessarily happening before you've made any effort whatsoever yourself.In that regard, you can first form a position on the question, and probably actually using it for some mild effort toward deserving a response from said entity, would be useful.In forming a position, it can be helpful to, as I noted, read up on ""supervenience"". It has to do with the relationship of causal levels. For example, one could conjecture that atoms behave deterministically. If you know precisely the state of the atoms, you know the state of a chemical comprised of them. If you know the state of the chemicals, do you then know the state, with certainty, of whatever you are considering that is made up of those chemicals? And where, if indeed it does, does this deterministic chain of causality theoretically end? Can you tell the state of people from their chemicals, and from there, determine the outcome of, say, the next election from chemistry?This is a difficult question to resolve in philosophy. Another offshoot of the question you could examine is the Mind-Body Problem.But for now, to make this (relatively) brief, I'll provide a quick counterargument to the material reductionist position, which most nowadays would (largely by repeated training and confirmation bias, I'd say, but I leave that to you) say immediately, ""yes, the election can theoretically be determined by inferences of chemistry"". It considers non-material things to not exist, or if they do, that they may as well not exist, from a causal or effectual perspective.There are many arguments against this, but I'll start off with a simple one. A question:""If the material universe ceased to exist, would 2+2=4 still be true?""If one, rather intuitively, answers yes to this, then one is stating that math is not physical, it is -metaphysical-. It is something not dependent or controlled by the state of underlying matter. How large is that domain of metaphysical, yet valid, things?In response to the previous poster's position, it is again a question of ""supervenience"", whether he is familiar with that term or not. He says, ""no"", that metaphysics cannot affect physical things, that it cannot have a causal effect on them. But then, if an engineer builds a bridge, using math, and the way the bridge gets built is dependent on those calculations and hence a physically-independent metaphysical thing, is math then not causally affecting the material world in terms of the constructed bridge?There are many other similar questions, like, where -exactly- is a given web site? It's ""in the cloud"". Okay, where exactly, then? The site could be stored on one or more servers, and the underlying code moved between servers at any given time. So, is the site independent of any -particular- material reduction? To all appearances, yes. Similar questions arise regarding the mind, and, say the thought experiment of replacing every neuron in your brain with a silicon equivalent, slowly, such that you didn't even notice it. Is your mind the same mind? If you know the state of all the neurons, do you know what's in that mind?As you can probably see, this subject is quite complex, and philosophers and theologists have examined and debated this for a very long time. Ultimately, you need to make a decision. Is everything materially reducible, or not? If you agree with the former, you may as well follow Dawkins (well, and get inevitably eliminated by evolution, but that's another issue). If not, then a non-material, metaphysical, yet causally influential entity such as a soul or a God, is not implausible.Anyway, this has been longer than I anticipated.

They were raised to be Christian in societies where other options were non-existant, not to be spoken of or at the very least harmful to their careers and social standing. Calling them Christian is about as relevant as calling them white or male when looking at successful Western scientists of their respective eras.Secondly, even as believers most of them clashed heavily with official religious doctrine, in both their personal lives and in their work. Presenting them as examples of smart Christians is dishonest when many of them were considered 'bad' Christians or outright apostates by their respective churches. It is like saying Rock is terrible because Nickelback sucks.And thirdly, all the people you named posessed qualities that enabled them to excel in their respective fields, unhindered by their faith (if they actually were believers). Mike Pence on the other hand has no quality to qualify him for the position, and he has demonstrated repeatedly that his faith makes it impossible for him to make rational decisions based on the facts available.

Five years later, it's clear that the response to the Charlie Hebdo attack normalized anti-free speech ideas that have become more influential in progressive discourse [tabletmag.com]. ""Almost immediately after the ambush on Hebdo, a political reaction to the attack coalesced in the American and Western press around the idea that the cartoonists really had gone too far with their drawings. While, of course, condemning the dreadful murders, certain sensitive observers, including New Yorker writers, countless online scribblers, noted poets, prestigious professors, PEN award winners, and other highly cultured and impeccably credentialed figures, hastened to point out that, yes, yes, it was a very nasty thing, the shooting down in cold blood of bawdy comic strip artists, but the cartoonists were, nevertheless, rightfully understood, enacting their own form of violence in their drawings. This interpretation of the deliberately planned mass shooting was expressed clearly, though never quite so honestly, through an echo chamber of columns, essays, tweets and public statements that blurred or erased the difference between speech and violence. When PEN, an organization created to protect writers and defend their freedoms, decided to give Charlie Hebdo an award for courage, objections surfaced immediately. ""I can hardly be alone in considering Charlie Hebdo's cartoons that satirize Islam to be not merely tasteless and brainless but brainlessly reckless as well,"" wrote the author and PEN member, Deborah Eisenberg. Was it the primary purpose of the magazine to mortify and inflame a marginalized demographic? Eisenberg pretended to ask, before answering her own question. It would seem not. And yet the staff apparently considered the context of their satire and its wide-ranging potential consequences to be insignificant, or even an inducement to redouble their efforts â"" as if it were of paramount importance to demonstrate the right to smoke a cigarette by dropping your lit match into a dry forest.Free speech, once almost universally seen as indispensable in free societies, is now commonly derided as a tool used by the privileged to subjugate already marginalized groups.""",DNS-and-BIND,1,1,0,0,0

59771870,125893946,"Indeed, The virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a mean estimate of 3.28 . This mean estimate is much higher than the seasonal flu, which has an R0 of 1.3 . What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads significantly faster than the seasonal flu. The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3% . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is below 0.1% . SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms . This makes it much more difficult to control. Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu. Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days. There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 whereas people regularly get annual flu shots. There is no herd immunity for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. See, for example, a Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people. Now consider the multiplicative effect that all of these attributes have for the virus. Compared to the seasonal flu, SARS-CoV-2 (1) spreads faster; (2) kills far more; (3) is harder to control; (4) requires use of far more medical resources; (5) for far longer a period of time; (6) has no effective treatment; and (7) can infect entire populations. These factors mean that SARS-CoV-2, if left unchecked, is far more likely to overwhelm a country's medical infrastructure. Additionally, when medical infrastructure is overwhelmed, the CFR will skyrocket because we know that 20% of cases require medical intervention. It doesn't take a genius to piece it all together.

59770786,125893946,"Indeed, The virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a mean estimate of 3.28 . This mean estimate is much higher than the seasonal flu, which has an R0 of 1.3 . What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads significantly faster than the seasonal flu.The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3% . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is below 0.1% .SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms . This makes it much more difficult to control.Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu.Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days.There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 whereas people regularly get annual flu shots.There is no herd immunity for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. See, for example, a Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people.Now consider the multiplicative effect that all of these attributes have for the virus. Compared to the seasonal flu, SARS-CoV-2 (1) spreads faster; (2) kills far more; (3) is harder to control; (4) requires use of far more medical resources; (5) for far longer a period of time; (6) has no effective treatment; and (7) can infect entire populations.These factors mean that SARS-CoV-2, if left unchecked, is far more likely to overwhelm a country's medical infrastructure. Additionally, when medical infrastructure is overwhelmed, the CFR will skyrocket because we know that 20% of cases require medical intervention.It doesn't take a genius to piece it all together.

As of this morning, https://covid19info.live/ [covid19info.live] is reporting 81275 confirmed, 2770 deaths, 30315 recovered. For a moment let's assume the CCP has accurate numbers. That means there are currently 48190 people who are still sick. I doubt they will all survive, but we don't know how many will. Let's also be optimistic and assume you can't get reinfected.

59762854,125755040,"As noted by u/HafomengThe virulence (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated between 1.4-6.49, with a mean estimate of 3.28 . This mean estimate is much higher than the seasonal flu, which has an R0 of 1.3 . What this means is that SARS-CoV-2 spreads significantly faster than the seasonal flu.The Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 2-3% . This is 20-30 times higher than the CFR of the season flu, which is below 0.1% .SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted without the infected showing any symptoms . This makes it much more difficult to control.Roughly 20% of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in serious symptoms that require medical intervention . This is more than 10 times the hospitalization rate of the seasonal flu.Symptoms from SARS-CoV-2 can persist over a month compared to the seasonal flu where symptoms typically tend to clear after 5 days.There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 whereas people regularly get annual flu shots.There is no herd immunity for SARS-CoV-2 which means that it can theoretically infect the entire population. See, for example, a Korean psychiatric department where the virus infected 99/102 people.Now consider the multiplicative effect that all of these attributes have for the virus. Compared to the seasonal flu, SARS-CoV-2 (1) spreads faster; (2) kills far more; (3) is harder to control; (4) requires use of far more medical resources; (5) for far longer a period of time; (6) has no effective treatment; and (7) can infect entire populations.These factors mean that SARS-CoV-2, if left unchecked, is far more likely to overwhelm a country's medical infrastructure. Additionally, when medical infrastructure is overwhelmed, the CFR will skyrocket because we know that 20% of cases require medical intervention.It doesn't take a genius to piece it all together.

Their king apparently didn't take this outbreak seriously. They did some rudimentary testing, and released nearly everyone to go home as they wished. One of the released passengers took a flight to Malaysia, where she was diagnosed with a fever and tested positive for the virus. Cambodia then blocked the remaining passengers from leaving, but by then hundreds had already left. Hundreds of potential ticking time bombs released into the global transportation system. Japan tried a draconian quarantine measures with the infected cruise ships in its ports, which was probably the correct thing to do.

The annoying thing is because of the incubation time, cases are ""locked in"" that you don't see yet; even if, say, South Korea's containment reaction was perfect and flawless, we wouldn't even see the effects until a week after they started (average incubation time 5-6 days); new ""already infected"" cases will keep showing up in the data.I wouldn't be surprised to see Italy and Iran get significantly worse, as these outbreak centres were just discovered. On the other hand, I wouldn't be surprised to see Japan start to improve, for the same reason as above. The Diamond Princess seems to be mostly over. With Shandong, since the prisoners are contained, the implementation of proper quarantine procedures in the prison should make it easy to contain (7 guards were infected, mind you, and some new ones may continue to be discovered over the coming days), but all of their contacts will now be under medical supervision.Apart from Shandong, China's strict quarantine measures appear to continue to have their desired impact... to the degree that the data can be relied on.

I generate these because of how terrible that ArcGIS page that many people have been using has been at presenting the nuance of the outbreak. I'm thinking about altering it to focus less on a province-by-province case in China and focusing more on breaking down international cases, since non-Hubei (non-Wuhan) China disease incidents have been collapsing, but some countries (esp. Japan and South Korea) have seen recent spikes.They're still identifying a significant number of new cases from the Diamond Princess. But you're right about the low mortality rate. There is some nuance, which WHO discusses, in that you have to balance the number of people who are sick but haven't died yet, against the number of people who have mild cases that were never diagnosed. A study cited by them suggests that the actual mortality rate might be only 0,3-1%, but it's very preliminary. The mortality rate has been much higher inside China (again, overwhelmingly Wuhan) than outside, likely due to the overloaded healthcare system.The low mortality rate can be seen in terms of the breakdown of cases. For example, in Tuesday in Hubei there were 69270 people under medical observation, 4194 suspected cases, and 41957 cases in the hospital. But of those, 9117 were seriously ill and 1853 in intensive care, and only a minority of those will end up dying. A lot of people have been making the mistake of confusing the ratio of ""confirmed fatalities vs. people marked as recovered"" with being a mortality rate. The vast majority of the people who have the disease will eventually be sent home as recovered, but they cannot be classified as recovered until doctors are completely convinced that they're no longer contagious.That said, it's still more dangerous than a typical seasonal flu, and it's good to see efforts to wipe it out. My main concerns at this point have nothing to do with China; they're with impoverished countries with broken healthcare systems. I'm particularly curious about North Korea, a country where even easily preventable food-based parasites are common, and where we're unlikely to hear about disease outbreaks unless they reach pandemic scale. China does regular trade with North Korea, after all. On the upside, China and South Korea have no interest in having a disease reservoir on their borders, so I'm sure they'd both offer support in terms of medical supplies, etc.",Rei,5,0,1,0,0

After I say that I like to explain why: There are a lot of trials on vitamin C and colds, of variable quality and people analyze these, so there are analyses of analyses.You can take vitamin C to prevent colds, or you can take vitamin C once you have a cold to treat it. The treatment trials show a modest benefit. But the reality is in terms of that effect, I don't think it has clinical meaning. In the prophylaxis trials — and prophylaxis means to prevent — the prophylaxis trials [show] in the average person, [Vitamin C doesn't] prevent colds.Our bodies are configured to keep vitamin C levels within a particular range As you take in more vitamin C, the amount you absorb from each dose goes down.

(China is a lot of people)How many deaths from other kinds of flu in in the USA?And exactly what do YOU think the WHO could do better than quote the advice of the best available doctors from the rest of the world?Think - if/when it happens in the USA, exactly what will Trump say when the WHO tells him what doctors tell them is the best thing to do?Here''s reason for the name.First, ""novel Coronavirus 2019"" or ""nCoV-2019"" is a mouthful. COVID-2019 is much easier.Second, coronavirus is common. Besides Covid-2019, we have SARS and the common cold. (Rhinovirus is another type of common cold as well, so just because you have a cold, doesn't meant it's from just a coronavirus). Thus, you can pretty much truthfully say millions of Americans have the coronavirus, because they do.So that's why we have nice names because we want to identify which strain we're talking about. Imagine if you got a cold and your doctor said you have a coronavirus. In this current time, that's not a very nice diagnosis now, is it? Especially since you probably have a cold.Influenza right now is running rampant. The CDC is estimating (because not everyone with the flu sees a doctor) around 20-30 million Americans have or had influenza. And somewhere between 10-30,000 people have died. These are numbers based on reports, so the actual number is likely higher - not everyone sick with flu went to the doctor so the CDC doesn't get numbers, and not everyone who dies could be reliably traced to the flu.Remember China has over 4 times the population of the US. so the numbers for influenza should be much higher.Source: https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/... [cdc.gov]Humans prize novelty. It's why 9/11 is a disaster despite more people dying in traffic daily, or why Covid-2019 is scary despite influenza having killed way more people the past few months 200 people probably died from the flu today in the US alone, and 200 more will die tomorrow and so on.",tlhIngan,5,1,0,0,0

This is like saying if you discover Coke can treat that virus, you can too file a patent and Coca-Cola can't stop you from doing so.2) whether or not such patent application can be granted depends on what the original inventor of the drug has applied their patents for. In this case, if Gilead applied the drug to treat only Ebola (as it was originally intended for) and nothing else, then the Chinese claim is very valid; however if Gilead's patent covers all corona virus (and with evidence to that claim,) then the Chinese claim is not likely to be granted;3) Patent laws in all countries include clause that allow the state to use the patent without permission of the owner under the disasters and other national security matters; the current virus outbreak can definitely qualify for such circumstance.

On the other hand, it's overcounted by the fact that minor cases (which appear to be common) may go entirely undiagnosed. The latter is usually considered to be a bigger factor than the former, but 2% is a good enough estimate for now.New infections that jump to humans are often more dangerous than ones that have been in humans for a while because they've not evolved to let their new hosts survive and spread the disease to others. As far as a new human disease is concerned, 2% is actually quite tame. 80% of the deaths have been people over 60 and 75% have had preexisting conditions, so it's basically functioning like a bad flu (but nothing like Spanish Flu, which humans basically inadvertently bred to be virulent).BTW, if anyone wants to track how the disease is spreading, I use the following code:province=""hubei""; wget -q -O - https://bnonews.com/index.php/...

In other words, the primary finding of this work are entirely a highly expected coincidence.All organisms contain a DNA code that has the genetic instructions for development, functioning, and growth - this is known as the ""genome"". You can imagine each genome as a book of instructions. What these authors did is look in the genome book of the 2019 novel coronavirus and identified 4 sets of letters that aren't found in the genome book of SARs, a related coronavirus. They then compared these letters to the genome book of HIV, and found some places where they looked somewhat similar - but not even identical. However, because these sets of letters were so short, they are often found in many genome books by chance - they way you might search for the phrase ""can be there"" in Google Books and find that thousands of books contain those words - but this is not an example of plagarism.Note here: We call these sets of letters ""insertions"" because they are in one genome, but not in a close relative - ""insertion"" does not imply human interference or engineering - it is an evolutionary term and refers to a natural evolutionary mutation.Here are the four insertions:TNGTKRHKNNKSRSYLTPGDSSSGQTNSPRRAThese four insertions are protein sequences, that are encoded by a DNA sequence (which you may know uses molecular ""letters"" of A, G, C, and T to encode for proteins, which uses 20 molecular amino acid ""letters"").You, dear reader, do not have to take anybody's word for it that these letters are a concidence - you can do the bioinformatics yourself!If you would go to: https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov... [nih.gov]You will arrive at a search engine for these genome books, kind of like the Google of biology. Click on ""Protein Blast"", because are going to search for these protein sequences.Under where it says ""Enter accession number"", you can paste any one of the four sequences above.And then you can hit the ""BLAST"" button at the bottom of the screen. In a few minutes you will get a set of results.Let's go through the results for the longest sequence, ""RSYLTPGDSSSG"", together.Under the ""Description"" field you can see resulting hits. The first hit you see is to ""spike glycoprotein [Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus]"" - this is good, because we know that this sequence came from this genome. Under ""Per. Id"" you can see the similarity of this sequence to other hits - in this case, you can start by seeing that this sequence is also found in Bat coronavirus, so isn't actually novel at all! And there are many comparative hits that as equally as good, or often better, than the HIV comparison.Let's then take a look at the second sequence, ""HKNNKS"", together.If you go through the same search process for this sequence and look again at the results, you can see hundreds of perfectly identical matches. Maybe you see Sipha flava - that's an Aphid, or Tetrahymena - that's an Amoeba. Drosophila is a fruit fly. Clearly this sequence is found in thousands of genomes.Fortunately, the search has a built in way of answering the question ""How likely was this result to have occurred by chance?"". It is called the E-value, or Expect Value - the number of times we'd expect to see this result purely by chance. As you can see here, many of the E-values listed on this page are greater than 7829 - so we'd have expected to see 7829 instances of matches like these completely by chance! This is not evidence for gene transfer or gene similarity - it's simply a coincidence. As you now search for the other insertions described by this paper, you'll see that all of them hit hundreds of other genomes simply by chance. It is no surprise at all that they could have matches with some similarity in the HIV genome.Congratulations!

59675430,124302122,"Viruses have no problem dormant for 30 days. Actually yes, they do. Even in ideal environments (low temp, low RH, or in water droplets), most can survive and still be infectious for at most a month. SARS-CoV, for example, can go 28 days at 4c and 20%RH. That drops rapidly with increases in temp and RH, and at 20c, you are looking at about 2 days before enough virus dies to make it nonviable for infection. When looking at a viral infection you have to consider viral load. A single viral particle will not cause infection, a minimum number is required to allow the virus to take hold. On a surface the viable viral particle number drops over time starting almost immediately. You also need to transfer enough from the surface to a spot in your body where it can bind. Viruses, including coronaviruses, are pretty specific to the types of cells they can infect. That's one reason common cold coronaviruses are not as dangerous as others (SARS, MERS, Wuhan), they don't bind well to lung tissues, they prefer the upper respiratory tract tissues. That is the difference between runny nose and potentially life threatening viral pneumonia. This is why surface contamination was only considered a concern in health care environments and places patients spent a lot of time in contact with the same surfaces (homes for example), and then only secondary to person-to-person transmission. A factory worker who spends, say, 20 minutes with a smart phone is just not likely, even if infected and not wearing a mask, to transfer enough viral material to that device that it could survive in sufficient numbers to be an issue. So if you wanted to be completely safe, you would just need to quarantine incoming good for 30 days (honesty, it's really not necessary at all, but if you are going to be paranoid, be really paranoid). The only goods I would actually have some concern about are meats. A lot of fish processing occurs in China, even for stuff caught in our own waters like Alaska. Anything not canned (canning process will kill the virus, and any other microbes, by design) would be a good environment to allow a virus to survive for a decent amount of time (again though, probably only up to around 28 days at the outside).

Finally, influenza has a very low mortality rate -- other comments here have put it at less than 1%, compared to the Wuhan coronavirus' 3% or so. While some of that may be because coronavirus is hitting dense Chinese cities that may be strained trying to care for that many people, some degree of it is likely because it's a more severe illness. There's no reason to panic about it if you're not in one of the heavily hit areas, as ongoing efforts to halt or slow the disease's spread have been at least reasonably effective so far. But dismissing it because the number of people it has killed in the small handful of cities where it is widespread doesn't match the number of people killed by an illness whose scope is currently global -- that just demonstrates your ignorance.",twocows,4,0,0,0,0

59666410,124084370,"I made a previous post [slashdot.org] that outlined the situation and stated that there was not much to worry about.Since that time (one week - last Tuesday) two new pieces of information have come up that change the situation outlook.Firstly, a whistleblower from China has said that 90 thousand people are infected in China, and that official reports are playing down the scope of the problem.This is not particularly concerning if you're outside China, the Chinese government underreporting the severity of the outbreak was entirely expected. Because of quarantine measures in the rest of the world, there's probably little reason for concern. The 90,000 figure might itself be an exaggeration, and with the state of MSM reporting in the US it wouldn't surprise me if this is completely made up. It would generate more clicks than the Covington Kids thing last year, and that was a complete fabrication.(My personal opinion: It's probably somewhat higher than the officially reported 4,500 cases, but not 90,000.)Secondly, and more concerningly, it's been reported that a person with the Wuhan virus could be infectious for up to 14 days before showing symptoms [sciencealert.com].If true, the situation could become quite dire indeed. There are 5 cases in the US quarantined, but which could have been spreading the virus for several days beforehand. There are similar numbers of cases in other major countries (Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, the United States, France, Australia, Malaysia, Nepal, Germany, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, and Canada).The known cases were in California and Arizona, and California is known for a large homeless population. The SARS virus (another Coronavirus) can survive a few moments when aerosolized (sneezing), a few seconds on a surface (doorknobs, &c), or for up to 4 days in human feces. If the Wuhan virus is similar, then the homeless population of CA is especially vulnerable.The 2nd point - that asymptomatic people can be infectious - is disputed, and it's hard to find completely reliable information (given the current state of MSM) so it may not be an issue. My impression is that world health officials think that it's *not* contagious until symptoms are shown, and only Chinese officials saying it is.For a comparison situation, consider the MERS outbreak [wikipedia.org] a couple of years ago. There were cases in Saudia Arabia very near Mecca and it happened right before the hajj of that year. I remember thinking at the time ""this is the one"", expecting that people would get it at the hajj and spread it worldwide. MERS has a 30% fatality rate.And nothing happened.The Wuhan virus has about 1/4 the fatality rate of SARS, about 2.5%, which is the estimated fatality rate of the 1918 epidemic. Unlike 1918, most of the world has better nutrition, access to health care, and worldwide policies for dealing with outbreaks.It's still a very good bet that this won't turn into a world-changing event.And of course the situation changes hourly, so... maybe keep an eye on it.",Okian Warrior,5,0,1,0,0

If you take issue with Trump, it's likely because you disagree with his politics or dislike his behavior or both. Your goal should be to point out the most egregious examples of poor politics or poor behavior to strengthen your point, not to wisecrack anytime he does anything and make yourself look like a partisan hack. It's why I roll my eyes when my liberal friends make dumb jokes about his hair. It might be funny among people who share that opinion of Trump, but those aren't the people who you need to convince.",twocows,4,0,0,0,0

Transmission via large-particle droplets requires close contact between source and recipient persons, because droplets generally travel only short distances (approximately 6 feet or less) through the air. Indirect contact transmission via hand transfer of influenza virus from virus-contaminated surfaces or objects to mucosal surfaces of the face (e.g., nose, mouth) may also occur. Airborne transmission via small particle aerosols in the vicinity of the infectious individual may also occur; however, the relative contribution of the different modes of influenza transmission is unclear. Airborne transmission over longer distances, such as from one patient room to another has not been documented and is thought not to occur. All respiratory secretions and bodily fluids, including diarrheal stools, of patients with influenza are considered to be potentially infectious; however, the risk may vary by strain.https://www.cdc.gov/flu/profes...
