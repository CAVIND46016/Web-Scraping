c51727,a000808,"Hi Bruce! I actually have a plot in this vein.  The story is 'high concept':  One of Nikola Tesla's inventions was this ""weapon to end war"", early in the 20th century.  The stuff that in real life the FBI confiscated upon his death.  In my plot, some bad guys manage to obtain the plans, build the weapon, and plan to do Very Bad Things with it. This applies to this posting because in my story, like in real life, the bad guys use innocuous technology to build something very dangerous and lethal.  In real life, there is tremendous oversight of exotic things like nuclear materials...  some guys building a weapon with 100-year-old tech aren't going to raise any eyebrows.  A similar thing could happen where the bad guys use bio weapons, or off-the-shelf industrial equipment to build lethal devices.  Cyberwarfare has a relatively low cost of entry, etc. So... here's my plot description: The deadliest weapon ever was invented over a century ago by a genius equal to Einstein.  It's more powerful than a nuclear blast and more lethal than all biochemical weapons... so dangerous that the U.S. government seized its plans and buried them in a vault in 1943. Until now. The most sinister organization in history has stolen the plans to rebuild it. The Rebirth Alliance will use the weapon to defeat the free world. Francis Montagnet, a former undercover agent, and doctor Varenka Ulyanova, race to stop the Rebirth Alliance across two continents before this destructive device becomes operational. Will the daring Francis Montagnet and the brilliant doctor Varenka stop the Rebirth Alliance from firing the weapon and annihilating millions of people?

c51734,a000808,"Exploding nuns: A bunch of adults (clean-shaven males wearing makeup, or females)  dress up as nuns to hide their super-sized suicide vests. Without credentials and without being searched, they can walk into any school, parochial or public, or any religious building, or any other public place, and move to the center of a crowd to detonate. After the initial shock, the public will be terrified of nuns. Exploding clowns: See 'Exploding nuns' SWAT Surprise: A team of men decked out in SWAT gear, heavily armed, have a truck painted appropriately but carrying a truck bomb. The team can penetrate anything anywhere without credentials or searches, machine-gunning people trying to escape the carnage of the truck bomb. A couple dozen of these striking across the nation will make the public fear SWAT, and be wary of any police. Bomb Scare with a Twist: At the target building, preferably holding thousands of people, a dummy bomb is planted and a bomb threat called in. The object is to see where the evacuated people concentrate. The actual attack starts days later with a bomb threat, followed by an exploding squib, forcing evacuation out to the concentration areas, where, subsequently, half the car bombs are detonated. When emergency services arrive, the other half of the car bombs are detonated. The Trouble with Air Freight: The terrorists ship to themselves by air freight innocuous packages that will log altitude against time, teaching them the day of week and time of day at each shipping point to get the package in the air for a preset weekday and time. Then, for Trouble Day, they ship hundreds of bombs by air freight, timed to go off about the same time. Most will be in the air when they go, taking out hundreds of airliners and air freighters. Gasoline Glut: A gasoline tanker holds about 25 tons of fuel. No one would pay much attention to and extra 100 such trucks moving onto Manhattan Island one morning. At the preset time, the drivers would stop their trucks, start pumping fuel onto the streets and into sewers, set off igniters, and run. FDNY would be overwhelmed by 100 such fires, so most fires would burn freely, causing building fires, which in turn would cause collapses, adding fuel to the fires, and within days Manhattan would burn to the ground. Ubiquitous Forties: Forty-foot shipping containers abound in New York City and few are ever inspected. A hundred of these could each hold 20 tons of explosives and a timer. On Detonation Day, at about the same time, they all detonate. The neighboring buildings will come apart and catch fire. FDNY will be overwhelmed, and most fires will spread unchecked, collapsing more buildings, exposing more fuel, and over days Manhattan will burn to the ground. Burning Los Angeles: Unless there's rain in the forecast, any day will be a good day for brushfires. Early in the morning on D-Day, start a hundred brush fires, helped by morning breezes, which will pull most firefighting resources away from the heavily populated areas. Midday, start hundreds of fires in the populated areas, too many for the firefighters to get to. Evening breezes will help spread these.

c58809,a000808,"maximum terror and economic destruction are different scenarios. the economic angle has already been covered quite well in the wall street CO scenario, and i hope that's a candidate for your best plot. it's very realistic and these localities of high infrasructure value are horribly exposed. no need to poison water supplies or taint oranges. just bomb the telecoms. for maximum terror, the perps should target random and well-dispersed localities across the US, be time-coordinated, with some targets chosen for maximum population density, while others are chosen to bolster the belief that even smaller towns aren't safe. don't target anything under 5,000 people, since no one will really care. use all 30 perps in a thoroughly randomized matrix so that target patterning is difficult to establish. the point of this approach would be to cause 'ordinary' people (as differentiated from the 'extraordinary' ones in larger metro areas which get more news coverage usually) to first sympathize with the helpless victims, but quickly fear for their own safety and begin to change their daily routines. terror is about being so frightened for what *might* occur, that you radically alter your way of life. i know on 9/11 i turned around and went home, not knowing if the large multinational i work for would be targeted. large-scale behavioral change is key. the terrorist approach should persist so long as the perps are alive and free to act, and should continue in random fashion, with similar modes of attack, such as shoe bombs, car bombs, etc. since bacterial or viral attacks are too far from the popular psyche to be 'real' enough. all attacks should be easily recognized as terrorist-originated, rather than random accidents. despite the public's general unfamiliarity with biological weapons, even a tiny bit of plutonium, however, properly dispersed, is astoundingly lethal, and would quickly waken an ignorant population to its vulnerability. this could be the coup de grâce or perhaps only the first attack. at some point not far into this terror strategy, the government would likely enact martial law, which would further disrupt the newly unsettled masses.",maximus,2006-05-17 22:05:00

The year is 2027; President bush the 3rd is near the end of her first term in office; the completion of the base on Mars is due just in time to help the election.   At the same time a Gonzales comet is due to pass close to earth, being slightly deflected to demonstrate the American ability to do it. Terrorists manage to get on the American mission to Mars.  They stick with the mission until a month into space (on the far side of the sun).  They kill the other members of the mission and then redirect the rocket slightly.  They blame the loss of crew and deflection on an explosion when the get back into radio contact. To save the missin they agree they need fuel from the deflector rocket, so the arrange to meet up with it and take control of it. By setting the deflector rocket off course; instead of directing the comet away from earth, the terrorists direct it towards Yellowstone.

c51792,a000808,"Attacking the Super Bowl may not make a good movie, but it makes a
fine terrorist attack. You just have to do it right.  I read a scenario where terrorists use crop dusters to spray mustard
gas over the stadium. The problem with that is that mustard gas isn't
very telegenic. It's just this liquid, and symptoms don't appear for
hours. You'll shut down the Super Bowl, and you may get some panic in
the stands, but all the victims will be off camera in emergency rooms
before it gets gruesome.      I'm a terrorist.
I want some terror.
Live. 
On television.
I want...NAPALM.     Napalm is easy to make. Just mix gasoline and liquid soap. (Like those
two fools in the UK last year
http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/05/24/1412253&tid=97&tid=101)   Gasoline and soap are cheap, readily available, and no one pays any
attention to how much you buy, unlike, say, pseudoephedrine.  You do need the wits to mix the ingredients without setting yourself
on fire, but once it is mixed, you can store the stuff safely in sealed
plastic or metal containers (like the gas can in your shed out back).   Ignition isn't a problem. You just spray the stuff and the first lit
cigarette sets it all off.  Could an attack like this work? Well...maybe. The first question is
how much napalm are we talking about here?  A big stadium seats something like 70K people. If you could deliver 1
liter of napalm per person, you'd kill everyone in the stadium, and
the fire would probably melt the stadium down to its foundations.   But 70K liters is 20K gallons. Big 18-wheel tanker trucks hold 8000
gallons. So we're talking 2 or 3 tanker trucks here. And you can't
drive the stuff into the stadium: you have to fly it in.   The biggest aerial firefighting planes hold 7000 gallons. You'd need
three of those. There are only two currently in service, and they are
both in British Columbia, which is an unlikely venue for the Super
Bowl.    A C-130 cargo plane can carry 32,000 Kg, so you could do it with two
of those. (1 liter ~ 1 Kg). But really, only in the movies do people
steal something the size of a C-130 off of a military base. Even if
you can find some that are privately owned, and unattended during the
Super Bowl, unskilled terrorists aren't going to get a 4-engine
turboprop fueled, readied, loaded with 8000 gallons of napalm, and
into the air. Not even with some flight training.       The biggest crop dusters carry 800 gallons. Doing it that way would
take 25 planes. A terrorist with some flight training might get a crop
duster into the air. (http://www.stimson.org/cbw/?SN=CB2001121259
suggests that they might not.) But 25 terrorists and 25 airplanes?
Each fueled, loaded, and piloted by a single terrorist? Without
attracting attention? Without the whole plot collapsing from its own
complexity?       But maybe we don't need 1 liter/person. In fact, maybe this is a case
of less is more. If you incinerate 70,000 people, it is a tragedy, to
be sure, but the rest of us just pick and get on with life. We don't
even incur any burial costs.    But suppose we only deliver 100 mL napalm/person. We're not going to
kill everyone, or obliterate the stadium. We may only kill a few
thousand people (For all their destruction, the 9/11 attacks killed
fewer than 3000 people.)    Be we are going to create utter panic in the stands, and tens of
thousands of casualties, mostly 3rd degree burns. Some of these people
will eventually die, many will be permanently disabled or disfigured,
all will have long, painful recoveries.    Emergency and medical services will be completely overwhelmed. Total
health care costs will be in the billions. The victims will be on
television--news, interviews, talk shows--for months, possibly years.   And 100 mL/person is only 2000 gallons. So now we only need 4 crop
dusters. Go with 4, and hope that 3 reach the target (same success
ratio as the 9/11 attacks). Each plane gets a crew of 4 to 7 people:
one to pilot, one to fuel the plane, one to load the napalm, one to
coordinate. The 4 teams are mostly independent, so the whole operation
doesn't get too complex.      You might not want to use actual crop dusters: they are set up to
deliver pesticides and fertilizer, not incendiaries. Also, the
government has been watching crop dusters since 9/11. (In fact, crop
dusters were grounded in the months following 9/11.)    Instead, you could get a cargo plane of similar capacity and load the
napalm tanks into it just before takeoff. You'd have to design and
build your own nozzles to disperse the napalm.   Doing this in a stolen plane would be tough, because you wouldn't get
a good look at the plane until the operation was underway. It might be
better to just buy some planes. $500K isn't enough to buy 4 cargo
planes, but it might be enough to lease them, or buy them on credit.
You'd need to establish a business front to do that, but the necessary
fraud shouldn't be a problem for an international terrorist
organization. If you schedule things right, you should be able to
complete the entire operation before the first monthly payment comes
due.         With planes under your physical control, you can design, build and
install the delivery system in your own time. You can even do trial
runs (with soap, no gasoline) over the desert. (The 9/11 attackers did
trial runs--boarding planes and sitting in 1st class.)    On the other hand, maybe we don't want to build a delivery system.
Tanks, hoses, valves, nozzles--it gets complicated. Maybe...maybe we
just put the napalm into one-quart plastic milk containers, with screw
tops. 8000 containers, 2000 per plane. Fly over the stadium and push
them out the back. The containers burst on impact and badness ensues.     Now we need two terrorists in each plane: one to fly and one to bomb.
But the whole thing is simple enough that doing it with stolen planes
becomes feasible again. (Although it is still more complicated than
the 9/11 attacks were.)    Other issues
+ The pilots don't have to believe that they are on a suicide mission,
  which presumably makes it easier to recruit them.
- Doesn't work on a covered stadium. Super Bowl XL was in a covered
  stadium. Super Bowl XXXIX was in an open stadium.
- Does the air force provide air cover for the Super Bowl?
- The networks got Janet Jackson's tit off the air in about 2 seconds.
  Presumably they'd have the wits to cut away from an incendiary
  attack on the Super Bowl. So it might not really be live on
  television. 
+ But the cameras would keep rolling and the footage would come out
  later.            Scorecard (points out of 5)  - Cause terror: 3/5
Most people never attend a Super Bowl, so they won't feel personally
at risk from this.   - Make the American people notice: 5/5
No question: everyone will know about this.  - Inflict lasting damage on the U.S. economy: 2/5
Sports, broadcasting and advertising will take a hit.
Medical costs will be huge.
Doesn't affect basic infrastructure, military, or economic capacity.
Although the effects could be magnified if it stampedes the country
off another cliff, like the Iraq war.      - Change the political landscape: 4/5
Very likely, but hard to say how.
Could unite everyone behind Bush again; could turn everyone against
him.    - Or the culture  ???

A team of guards at several high-rise accounts decide that turning their hands to terrorism is their only hope of getting a pay raise . . . with shades of Ocean's 11 meets the Andy Rooney Show. 3) Mall Rats: why are all the kids doing their shootings at high schools, when adults are the enemy and the body count is higher at the shopping malls?

c51838,a000808,"P r e p a r a t i o n : One terrorist (the brightest of them) learns how to synthesise certain chemical substances. This should be more easy than leaning how to fly a jet (were talking about simple substances here). The terrorists found a small company with a suitable name, like ""ABDUL research"" or the like, as a cover to buy a larger amount of chemicals and processing equipment from various vendors. Then they synthesise a suitable drug. LSD might be suitable, because you can shoot a person away into nirvana with a very small dosis of about 500+ micrograms. Or they could synthesise DOM (2,5-Dimethoxy-4-Methylamphetamin), which would be suitable because it takes a long time before the effect sets in (2 to 3 hours) and the effect lasts long (24 to 72 hours) and its hallucinogene effect is much stronger that the effect of LSD. Sadly, here you need about 50+ _milli_grams. The recipies are commonly available. (A warning for potential users: The mentioned dosis is for terrorists who want to inflict harm. For normal use a smaller dosis would be very much advisable). A d m i s s i o n : Now they need to bring the drug into people. There are a lot of possibilities. - They could sneak into plantages at night and inject the drug into aplles, peaches or other food. It takes time until it gets to the consumer - They could accept jobs at food factories. Just pour it into the yogurt mixing bowl when no one is watching. This has the advantage that you can prepare whole charges at once. If neccessary, they can arrange a need for new employees by arranging accidents. This can be done with a lot of food: canned food, milk products, chocolate, anything. - The most suited product to put the drug into is - of course - baby food. Suddenly the baby behaves strange. Babies behave strange all the time - it would take time until one finds out that a hallucinogen is the cause. And an attack on babies is what the people fear the most. - Preparation of expensive food would be desirable, to target a greater number of people in key positions of economy and politics. T e r r o r : Well, taking hallucinogenes is not as much dangerous as everyone thinks. If you know how to deal with it. If it grabs someone hard and unprepared, fear, terror and panic will be the result. The drugs may start their effect in the most unconvenient moments. We can have a lot of fun with this:

- Aiplane pilot starts seeing (hostile?) UFOs
- Man (with gun at hand) is at home and his wife and children come home. All he sees are people taken over by aliens
- doctor is doing an operation and suddenly sees large number of small insects crawling inside the patients body, having a nest in the stomach
- Children at school start imprisoning (or even torturing?) teachers
- Effect on soldiers in a military base. They might be in a drill and guns might be ready.       Once the source of the strangly behaving people is known, there exists a problem. You can not test food for 240M people for drugs. What to do? Might take a while until every last one of 20 terrorists is found. The terror goes on.

Now for the movie scenario: the trigger could be some medicine: you take it, half an hour later you blow yourself. More realistic you use some sort of piercing, body-mod, plus some random electronic gear cell phone, mp3 player to act as detonator. So you can get this people anywhere you want, they do not look suspicious, they have nothing to hide, dogs cannot find any sort of explosives. For targets you have to choose random places with a lot of people. The first series of bombing should be in location where there will be maximum publicity: plane, tourist spot, ""secure"" location like a court room, a political meeting. Then move on to the normal civilian targets like schools, supermarket, hospitals and so on. Going from the TV to the street so that people will start to suspect the guy sitting next to them.

c51858,a000808,"Okay, this is just too tempting a topic.  Call this suggestion ""Tickle-Me Elmo."" Terrorists obtain jobs working for major toy retailers, insert bombs into this season's new must-have toy.  At 4 PM on Christmas Day ten thousand small bombs kill kids nationwide. Constraints:  The toy must have some extra internal space to hide the bomb, and must be something kids are likely to be holding on to.  Video game controllers spring to mind.  The toy must be on sale for only a short time before Christmas (to minimize the risk of detection), but many must be sold from each individual store (to maximize the effect of a small number of terrorists) -- again, video game systems meet this requirement.  Easy-to-remove external screws or seams a plus. Cost:  A dozen terrorists with rudimentary screwdriver skills, a few thousand small bombs, and a lot of late nights building the rig.  Still, fairly cheap.  Double-bonus if you can find one store or warehouse owned by a sympathizer; do all the work there, and just swap normal for tampered units.  Triple-bonus if you can do this by subverting truck drivers. Terror impact:  Huge.  Nothing like targeting children to piss off Americans. Economic impact:  Mega-huge.  Childrens' entertainment is a vast part of the economy, and would be decimated overnight. Bonuses:  This would work wonderfully with ""dirty"" bombs.  The big problem with a radiological weapon is that it only contaminates a small area, which can be evacuated and cleaned up.  These could contaminate thousands of houses across the US.

c51859,a000808,"OK, we start with a simple premise.  Several teams of 3-6 members in multiple cities.   Each team is equiped with a van, full body armor, ak47s, and grenades.  They pick local targets of interest in their particular cities like airports, malls, mass transit, any place people gather in crowds outside the security check points. Attacks are staged like the California bank robby that turned into a walking gun battle or the Columbine High School attack.  Atackers enter the target at one set of doors and just try to walk to another exit, meet the van and escape.  Shooting everything that moves in between. Repeated attacks over several days/weeks. Movie covers the teams planning and trying to avoid detection.  As the movie progresses, we learn more and more about one of the men near the top providing equipment, money and intel. This man will provide the warnings that allow some of the teams to escape arrest or early detection.  As each warning is given and happens, the viewer comes to realize that this man is actually a government plant. Then as the teams usefulness lessens, the man sets them up one after another for final ""suicide"" missions. he last team being taken down in a huge gun battle and the scene jumps to a government office where the inside man is being thanked for his service to the country by a man whose face we never see but sounds like the president.",lowkey,2006-04-02 09:33:00
c51860,a000808,"OK, here's the plot: 1 - Buy some factory space with a garage big enough for thirty trucks; 
2 - Buy thirty 7.5-tonnne box trucks; 
3 - Replace the roof of the cargo compartment in every truck with removable canvas; 
4 - Instal home-made mortars in each truck (if you can import 120 military-issue belt-fed mortars instead, so much the better); 
5 - Drive to 30 oil refineries or - better still - identify 30 depots, transfer sites and pumping nodes that serve a region of the USA; 
6 - Light the blue touch-paper; 
7 - Boom!
8 - A large region of the USA grinds to a day or so later.
9 - And stays shut down, a year or so later.         No, you won't truck in replacement supplies - strategic bulk commodities like petroleum are way out of the reach of your highway network (and its limited tanker fleet capacity), they have dedicated transport infrastructure that terminates at the target sites. Or rather, terminated at the sites before the sites were terminated. For extra effect, install motorbikes in the trucks and give the driver an escape route for the next campaign... Or a machine gun and enough grenades to disrupt the firefighting effort. He won't last long, but paradise awaits and the fire trucks (and the trained fire crews who can deal with a refinery fire) are irreplaceable, and in very short supply. Time is also in very short supply; without immediate intervention, refinery fires can rapidly overwhelm the local safety systems and engulf the entire installation. Assuming that the attack, with its multiple sources of ignition, didn't do exactly that. Actually, you could get the attack to work with ten light trucks, each containing three men and a full load of RPG-7 rocket grenade launchers: two men to fire the things through the perimeter fence and one to hold off the security guards and their ceremonial handguns with a tripod-mounted heavy machine gun. Factor-40 sunburn cream and/or fire-resistant overalls will prolong the mission by several seconds, assuming the Jundi lack the brainpower to fire at max range and drive around the plant starting several separate concentrations of fire. You might've guessed from the spelling that I'm from England: if you follow the international news, or you've tried to get a connecting flight at Heathrow, you'll know that we had a major oil distribution depots shut down by a fire recently. It turns out that we don't have very many of these installations; I should be glad that the IRA took so long to figure out that economic targets are effective targets, and that Her Majesty's Government caved in to their demands so quickly when the terrorists worked it out.

c51862,a000808,"There are two things that are key to a mass-casualty attack.  The first is fairly close synchronization.  If the attack unfolds over even as much as hours, information begins to propagate.  The Sept. 11 attacks ended up short a plane because of information flow, and that was only a delay of an hour or so.  To kill more than a few hundred people, you need synchronization or people will begin to respond and minimize the damage. The second is to cross a boundary into a ""safe zone"" -- the safer the better.  The best places to cross into are the private sphere (people's own homes), and security responses themselves (blowing up the security screening line, for instance). One boundary-crossing idea I've wondered about from time to time is truck-mounted mortars.  The IRA tried this a couple of times but couldn't make it work, but I think the principle is sound.  A mortar is easily constructed from simple materials, and can be scaled up almost arbitrarily.  It defeats ground-based security perimeters, but is not really susceptible to anti-aircraft defenses.  Modern GPS tracking should make it possible to make one self-aiming.  And you can load a mortar round with anything you like; Washington, DC is awfully full of flammable historic buildings. A dozen terrorist trucks with self-aiming automatic mortars pounding downtown DC.  Now _that_ is a movie plot.  For instance, it would contain car chases.  Every movie plot needs a car chase.

Each team has one or two gas saws (like a chainsaw, but with a cutting disk instead of a chain and bar). The teams pick the most inaccessible powerline tower for their assigned area, hike in, and at a designated time, cut it down. The resulting blackout would plunge large areas into chaos and riots. You'd likely take out a couple of the generating stations as well due to the wildly fluctuating electrical load as whole sections of the grid (hundreds of thousands of users go offline simultaneously).

See http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/ for the FOIA response that revealed this project. It is only a step from eavesdropping devices to bombs.

Everybody the truck drove past would sicken and probably die.  The truck could also conceivably leave the city and find a new one and drive around that etc. Another reason why this one is so bad is because the radiation is so hard, it will actually penetrate the concrete to a depth of up to 30cm, permanently contaminating it.

c51933,a000808,"Movie plot scenario: A team of Saudi Arabian students gain employment at farms across Vietnam under the pretense of researching the origins of the bird-flu virus. With excited villagers gladly leading the students to infected farms, the team quickly gains samples of infected birds. Unbeknown to all, the team works nights with more experienced researchers based in Saudi Arabia to study the virus and its ability to propagate amongst humans. In fact, the small team are actually found to be injecting themselves with the virus and synthetic strains they have made in order to study the effects and the ability to pass it amongst each other. Once the test subjects of the team start dying and other members who have not been directly injected with the virus fall ill, it becomes clear that the researched virus strains can successfully infect and propagates amongst humans. At this time the 'students' board different planes heading for America. Being Saudi Arabian and facing some suspicion by the authorities, the students are given a thorough screening at the airport, yet no weapons are found so they freely board the planes. However, the goal of the terrorists at this stage is not to kill with weapons, but rather to have the airplane air-conditioning units efficiently pass the virus they are infected with to other people on the plane. Once in America, the terrorist continue to catch flights to various capital cities, with the intention to spread the virus until it overcomes their own body and they die. It is not until several days later that some tourists from Vietnam start showing signs of illness and ultimately die. Panic spreads as all travellers start fearing that they were also infected. The airline industry is hit hard as people stop flying. The airline also faces the difficult task of allowing people to fly without the ability to detect whether they are free of disease. Fear also kills the bird trade, especially when foreign countries stop buying exported American chickens. Terrorists with links to AlJazeera and other such media start spreading rumors of detected Mad Cow disease in American beef, which is easily picked up as fact due to the bird flu virus in the US, thus further affecting the export of American food. Ultimately many people die until a cure for the virus is found and the American economy loses its position as strongest in the world.",Simon Ellis,2006-04-03 02:12:00

On Wednesday March 7, 2007 at 5PM, spam goes out stating an eccentric .com millionaire died with no heirs and wanted to give $50M back to the people by dropping money from helicopters. The first $1M drop is Thursday March 8, 2007 in New York, NY (Times Square) at 5 PM. 
	Watch mahem while people fight to collect free cash while traffic jams. 
	The first drop is only to guarantee crowds for the second round.   The second round of drops are Friday March 9, 2007: $1M at every US city over 500,000 people at 5PM, specific locations are provided. Only drop money at 9 more locations (see list below). 
Hollywood, CA (on the site of the Oscars)
Washington, DC (Lincoln Park across from White House)
Las Vegas, NV (Intersection between Excalibar, NY NY, MGM Grand)
Philadelphia, PA (Liberty Hall)
San Diego, CA (at the airport)
Seattle, WA (street next to Pike Place Market)
Columbus, OH (outside city hall)
Chicago, IL (outside Mercantile Exchange)
St. Louis, MO (at the arch)          Spam e-mail sent a few minutes after 5PM apologizes and explains that ""Government agents wearing dark suits seized the cash"" at other locations. 
	Watch mahem while anyone in dark suits gets beaten by crowds. 
Anti-government sentiments at an all-time high in non-drop cities.   The cash injection (and threatened cash drops) temporarily causes fear of inflation which throws the economy into turmoil. Massive amounts of money moved to inflation havens. Millions are made by shrewd traders. Follow-up spam e-mails with news of other drops. Congress passes law to outlaw dropping cash from helicopters. None of the subsequent drops occur, this is blamed upon the dark-suited government agents. The Department of Homeland Security denies seizing cash. Only it turns out the money is counterfeit! 
Companies start refusing cash payments, causing poor economic outlook. Congress amends prior law to outlaw dropping counterfeit cash from helicopters. The Department of Homeland Security issues no-fly order to all helicopters in the US.   Only it turns out the money is not only counterfeit, but also tainted with anthrax! 
US government (Center for Disease Control) first to break this news. This is decried as part of the government plot to stop the cash drops. Once non-government sources confirm government reports, massive fear breaks out.   The resulting anthrax epidemic causes hospital overload. Insurance companies deny claims. Personal bankrupcy hits an all-time high. Health care providers begin to go bankrupt. Congress passes law to outlaw health care provider bankrupcy. Foreign governments refuse to allow US cash, or US goods, into their countries. Trade imbalance grows. People, unable to use cash, burn it; causing fear of deflation as cash is destroyed. Massive amounts of money move into deflation havens. Millions are made by shrewd traders. The Department of Homeland Security issues instructions on how to properly destroy anthrax-infected cash. Congress moves out of DC to a remote location in the Shenandoah mountains, further fueling anti-government sentiments. People are afraid to leave their homes. Schools close. Businesses close. Towns and cities set up road-blocks. The country descends into warlord fiefdoms. ",DanT,2006-04-03 14:29:00

Ebola has an incubation period of 2-21 days so they have time to get to the U.S. or Europe.  They could fly to Mexico using fake U.S. passports (no Visa required) and then enter the U.S. illegally by hiring coyotes.  Once in the U.S. they go to public events and infect as many people as possible before dying themselves. The only difficulty I see is this mission would require a lot more courage then a regular suicide bombing mission.  That could be handled by giving them shots and (falsely) telling them that the shots will allow them to get sick enough to infect others but will keep them from getting too sick themselves.,Neal Lester,2006-04-03 15:19:00

c52047,a000808,"Balloon attack in the warn terr.
Take 30 terrorists; organize as 15 teams of 2 terrs each.  Each team is equipped with
2 man-portable cylinders of helium, with regulators
120 largish, clear balloons
10 1000' spools of 28-gauge copper wire
2 roll of kite string
2 box cutters      Total cost much less than $500,000.  Use the balance for rent, food, cars, gas money, pet dogs (see below), and lap dances. Deploy terr teams around the country, 5 to NYC metro, 5 to LA metro, 5 to Chicago Metro.  Or any other cities you don't like. Have each terr team scout out the corridors underneath major high voltage transmission lines.  Find the major corridors with 3-7 transmission lines crammed into one narrow path.  They are easy to spot, use G**gle Earth, USGS maps, or working eyesight to spot large metal towers.  Walk the dog in the corridors underneath the lines.  Find secluded spots. On T-day, all 15 teams go their chosen spots, with or without dogs. Check the wind by blowing up a few balloons and releasing them.  Unroll 200' of copper wire, perpendicular to the chosen power line, and directly beneath it, or as required to compensate for wind.  Each terr blows up a balloon with helium, ties it to the ground with 5-10' of kite string, then attaches the copper wire to the string, just under the balloon.  The tethered balloons holds the wire just above the well trimmed vegetation underneath each line so it won’t be snagged. Repeat 6 -10 times for 1 power line, moving at least 50 yards down the line for each balloon pair and wire.  Then repeat for the adjacent high voltage line.  Lay out 50 wires in all. Now the terr pair ditches their heavy helium bottles and get out their box cutters.  Using hand signals, they simultaneously cut the kite strings holding down one wire with a balloon on each end.  They quickly move down the line to the next, and repeat. As the wire is lifted up to the high-voltage transmission line, it causes an electrical arc.  Power flows from one high-voltage wire to the next until circuit breakers open.  A few seconds after they open, the circuit breakers automatically reclose.  The second balloon-borne wire causes a second arc.  The circuit breaker opens, closes again.  The third breaker causes still another arc.  The circuit breaker opens, and this time is locks open. The attack is repeated for all the transmission lines in each corridor.  In a matter of minutes, New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago have blackouts.  When the utilities try to manually close the circuit breakers, the additional balloon-wires are already in place across the lines.  They arc and the breakers trip right away. The attackers leave the area, assembly a second kit, get in their cars, and go to the areas around the next 3 big cities they don't like. Variations:  
1) Use 30 each 1-terr teams, tether one end of each wire, and cause a line-to-ground arc instead of going for the more spectacular line-to-line.  Attack 6 cities at once instead of 3.  Leave lots of clear balloons and skinny wires floating near power lines, waiting for the right gust of wind to push them into the wires and cause a short circuit.  2) Ditch the balloons, the helium, the wire, the rent, and the lap dances.  Buy explosives and timers and train the terrs to use them.  Scout out the corridors as before.  Find towers where the line takes a sharp bend, and cut the outer leg on that tower with the explosive and timer. Each terr is expected to cut one or more legs from at least 12 high-voltage towers.  Extra points for getting one tower to fall across an adjacent line.  Now the power systems to the targeted cities are shut down for weeks or months. Results: Major metropolitan areas in blackout.  Blackouts repeated many times as other disgruntled groups recruit terrs and repeat the attack along the 150,000 miles of high voltage transmission lines. Voters turn out in mass and throw all the bums out of office.  They'll stand for murder, they'll sit still for groping at airports, they'll accept ruinous taxes and deficits, but when the power goes out, the politicians follow.  Ask Gray Davis. American culture is forever changed when the new group of politicians realizes that they don't have long to line their wallets unless they can keep the power flowing.  They can’t recruit enough guards for 150,000 miles of line.  They have to stop the attacks at the source.  They offer peace terms to Iraq, Afghanistan, and the rest of the world.  All the troops are brought home, all the foreign bases closed. The Southerners, the rednecks, the ranchers, the rich, the businessmen, and even the gun nuts are made to feel welcome in American culture and politics.  The Bill of Rights is restored and politicians who don't enforce the letter and spirit of the Constitution as originally written are rapidly and firmly replaced.

c52049,a000808,"Here's an idea: multiple, coordinated attacks on polling places. Most US polls are located in public schools, libraries, and other extremely soft locations. Even just two or three attacks would be a major blow; five to ten well-planned attacks, either shootings or car/truck bombings, would be catastrophic. Strike early in the day – 10-noon. True, there will be significantly less casualties than right before closing time, when everyone lines up, but the effect will be to deter people from coming out and voting later in the day. For maximum effect, choose inner city polling places: not only have we seen that these polling places tend to develop very long queues, but also an attack selectively targeting the already-disenfranchised will inflict maximal societal damage. Furthermore, if no extra-constitutional steps are taken to nullify the ensuing election returns, this will generate not only a flood of conspiracy theories, but some well-grounded voting rights lawsuits.

c52051,a000808,"This is inspired by a puzzling new policy that law enforcement in L.A. seems to have adopted.  Any yahoo sitting in his old car by the side of the freeway, who ""may have a gun"" and ""seems unstable"" prompts a complete closure of all 6 lanes of traffic in both directions, for an indefinite amount of time, most often during the evening rush hour.  This achieves fantastic traffic density, which our movie's environmentalist radical group could use to destroy a large number of evil polluting vehicles at once. The group could call in 3 separate ""weirdo in his car"" incidents in a single afternoon, with the designated weirdos setting up far from available offramps on the busiest freeways, perhaps in mountain passes with high winds.  Simultaneously others in the group could hijack 15 gas tanker trucks and circulate them through the areas due to be closed, while the demolition experts could strategically set up orange traffic barrels full of explosives.  In real life such a plan might only kill dozens in sporadic fires, but in the movie you could imagine firestorms and mushroom clouds. Of course this would inspire fear, and even worse... travel by train.  The movie could end with some moron commenting how ironic it is that an environmental group would cause large explosions.

Still, reading some suggestions here gives me an idea that's about the same level as 9/11, causes even more damage; yet doesn't require anything nearly as complicated as hijacking an airliner. Instead, hijack a gasoline tanker-truck, and several fire-engines of the kind that have their own tanks for fighting fires out in the country where there's no hydrants. Fill the tanks with gasoline instead of water; drive into the middle of a city and start the thing going with a ""mist"" spray of gasoline going straight up, with the direction and all controls welded on, the engine-compartment welded shut, so that once started it cannot be stopped.  About the time the fuel is about to be all pumped-out, set off a spark. ****>>>> WHOOOM 
Air-bomb, or ""Bunker-Buster"".  About the closest thing you can get to a nuclear explosion with chemicals. And, like an airliner, who is going to suspect somebody of using a fire-engine as a bomb? About the only *defense* against the thing is like the airliners: Set it off BEFORE the terrorist does ... like *immediately*.  THEN you only get a large and dangerous fire; as gasoline in a tank or even a ruptured tank, just does *not* explode like you see in the movies.  I just BURNS, rather fast and rather hot.  Examples happen all the time around the world when large tanks of it catch fire.  Not very often; but a few each year around the world. It DOES however explode nastily, if finely mixed with air beforehand, like described above.  The military have special bombs based on such tactics. Cheap, easy to get, and large results.
What more could a terrorist want?  (Well ... The idea I decided *not* to post; but that's just too wicked.) If you want to make a movie-plot of it:  Have the terrorists *try* it out first ... say in some relatively small town or even uninhabited area.  They'll be ""working the bugs out of the system""; but your hero manages to figure out what the idea is when the wreckage of the truck is found; and people can't figure out why the fire-truck (supposedly there to *put out* the fire) has the controls all locked and the hood to the engine welded shut.

c52103,a000808,"this is so easy. the terrorist plot that would cripple the united states both politically and economically is suicide bombings at border crossings with mexico, bombings at oil refiniries (as was attempted in Saudi Arabia recently) and slaughtering oil workers on offshore drilling platforms in the gulf. think about it. this hits every political point that make americans queasy. Oil addiction, immigration (notably immigration of brown people, not white people), and Arab/Islamic terrorism. This is the plot. December '08: From inside Mexico, ten of the twenty get handguns and suicide vests, buy a few Mexican beaters and drive up to the border crossings at Tijuana, Nogales, Laredo, etc. They load the cars with bombs using training they got in Iraq (natch) and set them off as soon as they get to the American side of the crossing. Before setting them off they indiscriminately shoot Americans in uniform, because they're soliders of the crusading/zionist American/Jewish whatever. Why do this? Force American politicians to get tuff on border/immigration control, which from what I've been hearing lately from the Big Business wing of the GOP, would cripple the American economy. So, no cheap labor and no cheap imports from Mexico. The other ten buy a fishing boat or two and raid offshore drilling platforms. They slaughter the oil workers and set off bombs, destroying the platfom. This causes mass panic for offshore oil workers and they all refuse to work. Oil prices shoot through the roof, making the Katrina spike look like a Labor Day weekend. Why do this? Obviously, to brutalize the American economy by making energy prices too exorbitant to do anything. News reports of Alaskans and North Dakotans freezing in their homes because they can't afford energy prices, etc etc. Very Day After Tomorrow. Here's your David Mamet/Oliver Stone twist: It was the Nigerians! They needed the oil revenue increase to buy arms from the US to bolster their brutal regime, so the US could buy cheap oil from them!

c52136,a000808,"A group of recent retirees from a major energy utility band together to perform a coordinated attack on their former employer. Their impetus for doing this is that a recent merger has reduced their pensions & medical benefits almost down to nothing.

They are very patient, methodical and diligent in their planning and they wait for the exact weather conditions that will cause the most damage. They are all still very sharp, they know exactly when & where to hit the flow of energy to do the most damage. They start off by attacking a major site at a time of day when it will get the most media attention as it is planned to occur during the morning rush hour and this also causes major traffic problems. Their demands are the immediate restoration of all retired employees’ pensions and benefits but of course these are denied and they then proceed with the rest of their plan to shut down the entire energy network at the worst possible time due to the current weather conditions. SWAT teams show up and kill some of the retirees but most of their plan goes off resulting in terrible damage to an entire urban area.

c52222,a000808,"Lost Angels: Gridlock (made for TV, of course). 30 guys, $500,000 dollars, hm?  Okay. There are several main traffic arteries in Los Angeles.  The ones that would cause the most chaos: the East LA Interchange (the 101/5/10), the Orange Crush (the 22/5/57/55), the 405/101 Interchange, the 405/10 Interchange, the 405/105 interchange, the 110/10 Interchange, and the 110/5 Interchange.  Throw in the 91/605 Interchange for good measure.  You'll need 2 attackers for the first two, the others can be handled with 1.  That's 8 total, throw in a pair of roamers/backups for good measure. 10 guys need 18-wheeler training, say that costs about $500 a head (they don't need to drive very far), for $5K.  Maybe another $5K each to get them in country with suitable identification.  $55K.  They arrive close to target day.  That's group 1. Group 2 consists of three deep cover guys who have been here for years (5+) and who have small aircraft licenses operating out of Santa Monica Airport.  They've been mostly self supporting, but they probably needed some seed money to get started (say, $15K each), that's $45K, and we're at $100K and 13 guys. Group 3 consists of 10 suicide bombers with low-grade IEDs (let's use the napalm, since napalm looks great on film) and rental cars, that's a couple hundred for each IED and car (say $300) and maybe another $5K each to get them in the country, or $53K for that lot.  $153K so far, and 23 guys. Last group is two groups of 3 guys with fake Southwestern Bell vans and the requisite orange cones and equipment, plus some big bombs.  They're expensive (say each team requires $150K worth of training and equipment)  Now we're at $453K.  Assume cost overruns of 40K or so and we're still under budget. Movie starts with the Rose Parade.  Suitable shots of kids on shoulders and marching bands of high school kids from South Dakota (you can get a good 20 minutes of good human interest in here).  After the first two-thirds of the floats have gone the midpoint of the parade route, group 3 kicks into action, driving cars at high speed into the parade at multiple points, driving through crowds and blowing up in a burst of napalm.  You can have Stephanie get away but let Bob get caught in the blast, the parade insiders will think that's great.  You give the city a couple of days to settle - this is just an appetizer.  After all, part II works best on a non-holiday. Part II begins with the two vans of SBC guys setting up outside one of the refineries out by the airport (Chevron, for the sake of argument), right by the security gate.  It's not just one truck, so it looks really legit.  Before the morning trucks roll out to deliver gas to all the stations across LA (I'm assuming this takes place before rush hour, but even if I'm wrong, well, it's just a movie plot), one of the phone guys does a good looking accidental highdive off of a telephone pole.  Chaos erupts by the gate, two of the employees run over to the gate, then whip out guns and break in.  Telephone pole is chopped down, cell phone jammer activated in one of the vans, blocking cell phone calls.  Big bus arrives and guys spill out everywhere hijacking the gas trucks.  The 10 truck drivers head out, and the SBC guys wait 10 minutes and then spread out through the refinery, shooting people and setting explosives.  Lots of ""Phoom""ing.  Explosions are big and close to the airport, so attract immediate attention from the news helicopters. Trucks split up, head for the major traffic arteries.  They have CBs, so they can get in touch with each other if they have to.  They'll want to delay for at least an hour to give everybody time to get into place.  Meanwhile the three pilots arrive and take off from SM Airport. Trucks jackknife intentionally on freeways, spilling full loads of gasoline across rows of traffic.  Drivers blow themselves up, huge fireballs engulf commuters.  You can have the guy assigned to the 105/405 interchange take the 105 overpass and stop midway, then open the valves on the truck and rain gas down on the 405 below, then blow the whole shebang up.  Everything grinds to a halt, people get out of their cars and flee on foot, emergency vehicles are halted. One plane from SM flies over to the refinery and does a header into KCLA's NewsCopter at this same time.  This looks great on film, and immediately makes the rest of the news guys think about landing.  Reports start coming about freeways blowing up everywhere. Second plane buzzes the news helicopters, everybody panics (someone crashes for good effect).  Plane continues on merry way to LAX and does a chicken fight with a 747 coming in for a landing, losing on purpose (get lucky on the timing, and the debris can rain down on the 405 people fleeing from the burning cars just south of the airport). Last plane reaches downtown, buzzes Union Station, and does another header into the southbound Gold Line (don't want to forget those people who opt-out of the automobile culture in LA!).  If you're really lucky here, this derails the train. And there's really only a few failure spots.  The driver/Rose Parade teams only need to know the proper time and section of the parade to hit, so they don't need to communicate with each other.  If one or more of the tanker trucks gets stopped before target, it's not that big of a deal since you're still hitting several major arteries at once.  Of course, the SBC team could screw up, but you'd still get the refinery (plane 1 hits a tank instead of a copter, which still draws the news choppers), the airport, and the gold line.",Pat Cahalan,2006-04-04 13:48:00

c52275,a000808,"Okay, so I’m thinking like I’m trying to ruin another of Jack Bauer’s days, but here’s my plot. I’ll keep it brief, as it seems most others have. There are a total of three targets involved, and it does take some “movie style��? coincidences that might not happen in real life, but that’s how it goes, right? The events would take place on December 30-31st. The first attack is the destruction of the Hoover Dam. This should be relatively cheap assuming the terrorists have “inside men��? and at least one person who has a good enough understanding of where to place the explosives. When the dam blows, it’ll cause absolute chaos in that part of Nevada. This will draw both all active police and most of the available military into action to confront the catastrophe. In our little movie, there’s also a nuclear weapons test occurring in the Nevada desert. Because of the dam’s destruction, the test is put on hold and all the personnel who aren’t essential are deployed to help with disaster relief. At this point, a strike team of 12 (armed to the teeth, trained in how to use their weapons, driving Hummers or similar all-terrain vehicles) attack the testing area and steal the weapon. In terms of ironic plot twists, one could be that the weapon is a “dud,��? but for now, we’ll assume it’ll work. Once the weapon is secured, the vehicles should all spread, taking off to the east, west, north and south (so that any attempt to track the weapon will be that much more difficult). The weapon then needs to be moved to NYC (via airplane, I suppose-- I can visualize two operatives sneaking onto a FedEx flight or something similar). Once it arrives in NYC, there will be a cell of 10 or so operatives embedded in the security/tech staff for the New Year’s Eve celebration. Through their network of connections, their plan will be to place the weapon inside the crystal ball, rigged so that the action of the ball dropping detonates the weapon.

Even if the bridge doesn't collapse, it is unusable and may even require ""starting over"" to re-build.  If it does collapse, even though the Narrows is over 100 feet deep, the debris will certainly narrow the channel.

They periodically take target practice at local ranges. On the given day they assemble into 5, 6-man squads each with their own van. At the designated time each van arrives at an entrance to a large, well populated venue: school, mall, arena, convention, casino, cruise, etc. Each squad enters the venue and begins killing indiscriminately. When police arrive they do not wait and do not take hostages. Instead they immediately attack the police with overwhelming firepower. Ideally, they then move into neighboring neighborhoods, other businesses, etc. not stopping until out of ammo or dead. Remember the 2 bank robbers in L.A. and how long they held off 30 to 40 police.

c52321,a000808,"Spring Break Nightmare Every year 130,000 spring-breakers flock to South Padre Island, Texas.  Wet t-shirt contests, Girls Gone Wild video crews, and drunken debauchery take over the island for the entire month of March.  At night, many of the college kid make the trek to nearby Matamoros, Mexico, a border-town famous for catering to drunk Americans.  This is higher education at its best, and usually, all the kids take back with them are sunburns, hangovers, and maybe some incriminating pictures.  This year will be different. Several teams of young men have slipped into Mexico disguised as students and business travelers.  They are Al Qaeda operatives specially trained and selected because they don’t look Middle Eastern. These men have been recruited from all over the Muslim world.  Some are Asian, some Bosnian, others are disaffected North Africans from the Paris ghettoes.  Most of them do not look distinctly “Arab��?, and they do not hold passports from any Middle Eastern Countries.  Some have been in terrorist camps in both the Philippines and Malaysia.  Others have actually attended college in the US.  They all speak English and are conversant in the college lingo of “facebook��? and “myspace��?.  They blend. By twos and threes, the teams make their way to the border.  They rent a hotel room in Matamoros and don college t-shirts and flip-flops. .  They are ready to be martyred, and they won’t even have to cross into the US to do it. They have carried with them several small aerosol containers of weaponized smallpox acquired on the Russian black-market.  One afternoon, just a spring break in beginning to heat up, they face Mecca and pray.  Next, they inhale a mist of virus from one of the containers and spray it on their clothes.  Then they hit the clubs, human smart bombs on the attack. For the next two weeks, as the disease incubates in their bodies, they act like all the other drunken college kids.  They do tequila shots and keg stands.  Some freak dance with some hotties from Texas Tech.  Others get lucky with some girls from Arizona State.  All the while they are spreading smallpox both through physical contact and by spraying more of the containers in crowed areas. After two weeks, the terrorists begin to get a rash.  The disease is now as its most contagious stage.  Next comes the white pustules, and then a painful death or at least permanent disfigurement.  It's time for Phase II of their plan.  Attack North. That night, the teams split up make their way individually to the international bridge with all the other kids headed back to Padre Island.  This is the moment that all your tax dollars have been building up to.  Will these two men get caught at the border? For once, everything goes right, but it’s too late to matter.  Acting on information collected by the CIA and passed to the Department of Homeland Security, the customs agents on the border detain several of the terrorists.  Some slip past, but it’s a coup for homeland security as they have seemingly disrupted an attempt at terrorist infiltration.  The terrorist who are caught are detained in the Cameron County jail while the feds decide what to do with them.  They come in contact with guards and other prisoners—more targets courtesy of the US government. The terrorists are sick, but nobody notices.  The next day the FBI takes custody of the suspects and begins to question them. Two days later the suspects develop white pustules all over their bodies.  A doctor is rushed the holding facility. Within the hour panicked alerts begin to flash across the country.  Smallpox.  The nightmare is here.  Simultaneously, clinics at college campuses throughout the country begin seeing students with flu-like symptoms. Some of them have rashes.  In Mexico, the same thing is happening. The US has now been under biological attack for two weeks.  On the way home from spring break, the infected college students have passed through every major airport and traveled along every major highway in the US.  Mexico is now collateral damage in the global war on terror.  The clock is ticking on a biological time bomb.  Now what? Comments: 
Benefits: You can cast young, good looking people as the spring breakers.  You can have the Jack Bauer-type who “saves��? the day by figuring out that the infiltrators are trying to cross the borders.  Then you get a lot of cool doomsday “hotzone��? stuff with smallpox outbreaks across the country.   Drawback: Bringing in the attack under the $500K price would be hard.  You could get the teams trained and in place with that amount of money, but acquiring the smallpox would be tough.  We would have to assume that the smallpox was acquired on a separate budget line item. ",Kris Alexander,2006-04-05 10:58:00

I'm not quite familiar with the TV-program of the USA, but I think that ""Fox-News"" might be passable for two of the keywords above, so what to do with the remainding ""exchange""?
One of the official taboos seems to be a publicly visible image of naked people full or in parts down to small parts of the secondary genitals (""Nipplegate""), moreso if illustrating the act of making more people to make more people act and worse if children (I found no definition for ""children"", but I think I'm on the safe side with ""a homo sapiens before puberty"") can see these images.

- ""hack"" into the central computer of the Fox-News-Central
- replace any 1.000th or so frame with a picture of one ore more naked people.
- make it public

c52341,a000808,"""Frankenfood"" There's already a widespread distrust of genetically-modified foods in the world, particularly in Europe.  Here in the U.S. a growing number of people see ""organic"" foods as more healthy than foods produced through more modern cultivating techniques. The Earth Liberation Front (ELF) decides to seize upon this fear of genetically-modified food (""frankenfood"") to cause widespread panic and distrust of large multi-national corporations that engage in GM food production.  Thinking if they can only discredit these companies and their claims of safety, they launch a propaganda campaign... The ELF employs several groups to produce and spread their message. The first group infiltrate the production crew for the Superbowl.  Their job is to substitute the program produced by ELF for one actually scheduled to air.  Cue shots of technicians place devices with flashing LEDs into the crannies of production trucks.  Thirty seconds before the airtime of the add being replaced, out come automatic weapons and the team takes control of the production van.  They swap out a tape and air the following, produced earlier by a second team, using actors who think they're auditioning for a movie (cue flashbacks of the production): ""Hi.  My name is John Smith, and I'm the CEO of the Sonmanto corporation. We here at Sonmanto have been working hard for more than 100 years helping farmers here in the U.S. and abroad feed the world's hungry people.  Our scientists have spent decades researching how to make the most of the world's croplands and the best of the world's cattle. The fruits of our labors can be found in the cornflakes on the world's breakfast tables, the sweeteners in our drinks, the barley used to make the world's finest beers, and the beef on our dinner tables.  Chemists at Sonmanto have found ways to make the world's crops more resistent to disease and insects.  The hormones we produce make cattle produce more of the milk consumed each day by the world's children. Today, the over 100,000 people who work for Sonmanto make sure the world's growing population is fed daily. Allow me to introduce you to just one of our products, Triticum Aestivum; you know it as a common wheat used to make breads and cereals.  This is just one of the many grains our scientists have been modifying and manipulating to help feed the world. But that's not all our chemists have been up to since I took over control of the Sonmanto corporation almost ten years ago.  You see, the crops and hormones produced by Sonmanto do not resist disease, they harbor it.  For the last two years, you have been eating and drinking the toxins we have been placing in your food. Take this wheat for instance.  Embedded into the genetic code of this wheat is a slow acting toxin that builds up in the fatty tissues of humans and animals.  After eating this wheat for a year or two, the body becomes saturated and organs begin to fail. Early effects resemble a mild cold, but soon cancers, lesions, and crippling pain result until the person dies.  Cattle harboring the toxin do not suffer these effects but pass them on to anyone consuming them. All of the grains genetically modified by Sonmanto have been changed to corrupt other plant species through their pollens and seeds.  Wheat, corn, rice, soybeans, every major crop is now corrupt.  And with each day, the wind spreads our corruption to every field near our products. For years mankind has been raping Mother Earth of her bounty, poisoning her streams and her air.  Mankind causes the extinction of thousands of species with each acre of forest he cuts down.  You disrupt her delicate balance only so you can drive a larger SUV, alone, to work each day. Well starting with today, mankind's blight on this planet is ending.  Gaia shall be pure once again. Judgement day is upon you all."" Immediately after the ad finishes, the team destroys the production and transmission equipment and the Superbowl feed goes dark. A third group has planted some explosives at a small, inconspicuous laboratory owned by Sonmanto.  The lab has been chosen at random, but has been seeded with doctored ""research"" papers that will be found in the remains of the building after it has been destroyed.  The blast has been devised so as to appear as an almost successful attempt by Sonmanto to cover up their research and deprive the world of a ""cure"". Immediately, panic sets in as people assume they are all about to die.  Everyone becomes a hypocondriac, assuming each sniffle and cough will be their last.  It's the reaction to the SARS scare times 100,000.  People reject the food in their supermarkets around the world and the pitiful stocks of ""organic"" foods are fought over in riots and quickly run out.  Hundreds of thousands die of starvation, violence, and anarchy that results.  Foodstocks with even a hint of coming from Sonmanto are burned. The fear spreads to other large agricultural companies.  Assuming they must have a cure, anyone working for one a large agricultural companies, even secretaries, is mobbed and killed. No one listens to the scientists that inform the world there is nothing wrong with their food.  (The food is fine, ELF doesn't actually have the resources to pull this off) Other scientists struggle to search for a toxin and develop a cure for something that doesn't exist.  Charlatans sell phony potions to the gullible and desperate. By the time the truth comes out, millions have died in the panic.  In the aftermath, all aspects of food production are strictly regulated, monitored, and controlled.  Television and radio studios become fortified bunkers and anyone working with the media, both print and broadcast, requires an extensive background check and government license.  The First, Second, Forth, and eventually Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution are repealed so the government can make sure nothing like this ever happens again.

They explode the devices all at once while taking over the security force, who has less than half of their number on site at the time.

c52362,a000808,"This is similar to an earlier comment about ""nail beds"" across freeways, but I've had it in mind for the plot of a novel for at least a decade.  (I just can't get past the part where I actually have to write the novel). Terrorist teams of 2 - 10 men assemble in several large cities in the US which are dependent on busy freeways (Say, Los Angeles, Houston, Phoenix, etc.). Each target city gets several squads of terrorists, so that several main freeway interchanges may be targeted.  Each squad of 2 terrorists (one driver, one bombardier) takes a nondescript delivery van onto to a crucial stretch of freeway directly BEFORE evening rush hour, so that travel speeds are still high.  While driving down the outbound lanes of the freeway, the bombardier tosses out metal caltrops (think large, sharp metal ""jacks"") behind the van, puncturing the tires of all of the cars and trucks traveling behind, causing massive traffic accidents/jams.  For added psychological effect, the bombardier may want to toss some hand grenades or firebombs out the back of the van. Once traffic is at a stand still on the major freeways (In Houston, for instance, IH 10 West at the 610 West Loop, Highway 59 South at the 610 Loop, IH 45 at the South Loop and at the North Loop, Highway 59 at the North Loop), the squads can possibly snipe at any tanker trucks stuck in the Uber Jam with incendiary/explosive bullets from .50 caliber rifles.  They could also shoot at any first responders who are dispatched to the wrecks. End result is a city(s) in chaos.  Any one in LA, Houston or Phoenix can tell you what they city would be like if ALL the freeways were paralyzed at 3:00 p.m. on a weekday.

In the wintertime, wearing big coats, they smuggle in automatic weaponry and gun down hordes of innocent people at malls all around the US.  They then flee in the confusion, discarding the disguise, and move on to the next mall in town.  This results in economic crisis, as folks fear leaving their houses for any reason, and stop buying anything but necessities.  Also results in food riots in grocery stores as people stock up on ridiculous amounts of canned and dry goods.  After targeting malls for a few days, move on to grocery stores (which are already full of people as per the above.)  Schools and colleges follow as targets.  Once the American public, grieving, terrified and furious, is brought to a boil, utilize American Islamic extremists to carry out retaliation killings in the Middle East.  Dressed in burqas, they carry out similar killings, and when caught, tell everyone that they did it as revenge for the events in the U.S.  Framing the U.S. for these killings ignites righteous furor and leads to all-out war with the U.S.- perhaps even a nuclear conflagration.

First let me say that I believe that my understanding of a terrorist act is not how many people are killed, but how many are scared.  9-11 would have been considered a success by the terrorists who organized the attack, even if most of the people had escaped the buildings.  Anyway, here is the movie plot: Terrorists in different areas of the country, most in or near large cities, buy inexpensive old junker cars.  (Out of the paper or ones they see at the side of the road for sale to minimize paperwork.)  They rig these cars with a bomb and timer that will cause an explosion several days after it is started.  Make sure that the cars have the optimal amount of gas for the maximum explosion, maybe 1/2 to 3/4 of a tank.  Have a prearranged time for most of the cars to explode, with some going off hours or days later.  Abandon these cars on major thoroughfares and have the majority of explosions set to rush hour.  Terror will cross the country with the time zones.  The fact that random cars explode hours or days later will keep it going. The reason this would work is simple.  We’ve all seen cars abandoned for days at a time by the side of the road.  I’ve even seen them inside a supposedly secure area within sight of the gate.

Once the planning is complete and targets of opportunity are identified, the teams disperse. From then on each man operates individually and has no further contact with the other. Each man must obtain a .50 caliber rifle on their own, but ammunition is given to all at the outset. To minimize suspicion, they must take on the persona of a stereotypical pro-America avid gun-enthusiast -- including purchasing several small arms and making regular trips to firing ranges. On the given day, each man is to strike between 8:00 and 8:10 am to minimize federal recognition and response to a mulitple-threat attack. Armed with a .50 caliber rifle and a 2-4 Raufoss multi-purpose rounds, they shoot tankers of compressed gas -- preferrably in-or-near major soft targets like hospitals, schools, apartments, etc. or key infrastructure like highway interchanges, electric sub-stations, etc. RESULTS:
Cities in which two flammable targets are hit will overwhelm the capabilities of fire departments from these mid-sized cities. Cities in which one toxic gas and one flammable target are hit will slow the initial response to give the fire a chance to spread. Cities in which two toxic gas targets are hit will cause chaos as conflicting reports of gas type and source come in.  NOTES:
* Raufoss multi-purpose rounds  combines armor-piercing, explosive, and incendiary effects for maximum anti-personnel and fire start effect.

Here in Seattle we’ve just had a vivid reminder of how stone cold simple it is to assemble assault rifles, semi-automatic pistols, shotguns, & other tools of terrorist mayhem. Play the game in your head for a few minutes. My personal favorite involves the I90 floating bridge. Shopping List
Semi-automatic rifle - $800 - $2,000
(I’d likely spring for one of the AK-47 knock offs. They’re not as accurate as some rifles, but they’re legendary for reliability. Plus the large capacity banana clips are easy to find).
Assault pistol - $800 - $1,500
(I’d go with a semi-automatic version of the classic 9mm Uzi & then buy all the 32 round magazines I could lay hands on. I’m thinking I could carry at least ten.)
Personal body armor - $500 - $1,000
(There are some excellent performance reviews as a result of troop fatalities in Iraq. The point isn’t to survive…just make it harder, hence longer, before they can take me out.)
Caltrops - $0 - $250
(You can buy car caltrops on ebay, or make them yourself. They’ve been in use for a very long time.)
Binoculars - $50 - $500
(I’d spend extra on flare resistant coated optics.)
Optional DIY napalm            If you’re wondering how easy it would be to dig up the goodies on my list, take a look at http://www.gunsamerica.com/ (I’m thinking mail order is the way to go if you’re brown & ESL). Now that we have all the tools needed, you’ll need to cauterize your sense of right & wrong (or amp yourself up on a religious zealot trip). Pick an end of the bridge during rush hour (I’d go with the one closer to the city). If you check out the satellite pictures on Google you can see that there are some nice shrubs etc. for you to nestle into. Watch with the binocs until you see two relatively full buses are on the bridge at one time. Throw handfuls of caltrops onto the lanes entering the tunnel. Go to work with the AK-47. Given that the cars are only likely to be doing about 3 miles per hour it’ll be like shooting fish in a barrel. Once the tunnel has been fully blocked by immobilized vehicles throw as many one-gallon glass bottles of homemade napalm as you can onto the cars below (this doesn’t really serve a significant function other than to make it more dramatic for the news. Which is really what terror is all about). You could do something flashy like rappelling down (or you could do something simple like following the little ramp down to the side walk that runs along the side of the bridge). Unlimber the Uzi & start firing into the vehicles that are trapped in the traffic jam you’ve created on the bridge (well, I guess you didn’t create it. You just made it really, really bad). The individual cars aren’t really your targets. You just want to create chaos & make sure everyone keeps their head down.

Lots of good film footage of Times Square during the attack.  Cost is almost nothing for the attackers as they would not need even real chemical weapons.  The damage is caused by the panic and the followup fear in NYC.  Alternatively, use the same plot in Las Vegas as this would have good film footage as well. GG",Gray Ghost,2006-04-13 00:05:00

c53428,a000808,"There are a number of ways to create national panic with a small number of people and $500,000 or so. [1] A simultaneous attack to destroy key distribution centres for the main supermarket chains and make them unusable for a few weeks. These places are easy for an impostor to enter. He or she could bring in a truckload of explosives masquerading as a delivery. These distribution places don't have warehouses: they don't keep stocks of food. Supermarkets don't have stock rooms any more and rely on just-in-time logistics. Within a couple of days of the attack the supermarket shelves will be empty, helped along by panic buying. The economic and social impact of that would be non-trivial. [2] Attacks against oil refineries: for instance the sort of home-made mortars that the IRA used to attack Downing Street and Heathrow airport in the 1990s. These weapons would be inaccurate and indiscriminate. Though perhaps 10-12 per refinery would be enough to make each refinery inoperative. Watch society collapse into anarchy as people can't get fuel for their cars. Deploying snipers near the refineries and distribution centres against tanker trucks could have the same impact: drivers stay at home to avoid being shot. In a matter of days, the petrol stations will be empty. [3] Production and distribution of basic foodstuffs is highly centralised and is often done by a poorly-paid, casual contract workforce. [Read the chapters on meat-packing plants in Fast Food Nation.] It would be straightforward for a terrorist group to infiltrate these places and introduce contaminants into the food: E.coli or salmonella into meat, ricin into grain, etc, etc. If this was done well, it wouldn't even look like a terrorist attack. It would appear to be an accident or processing error at the plant.  For extra impact this would be done in several places at the same time. Come to think of it, destroying these places would also cause terror because of the immediate and long term impact that would have on the food supply chain.",Doctor Evil,2006-04-15 04:31:00

Confusion and life-threatening boredom reign supreme as the average citizen finds himself cut off from both his primary source of entertainment and his primary source of information about the outside world. Without television, Americans are forced to interact with their families and neighbors, read newspapers, and use the Internet.

The more grandiose the goal, the better. Assume an attacker profile on the order of 9/11: 20 to 30 unskilled people, and about $500,000 with which to buy skills, equipment, etc."" Well, unskilled people are difficult to employ in a sophisticated plot to take over the country, but maybe we can go and buy some skilled labor. I just lately read an article about bio hackers and having a biolab bought from ebay in your garage: http://www.technologyreview.com/BioTech/wtr_16485,306,p1.html This is promising, especially since it declares: ""This vision of subtle bioweapons that modified behavior by targeting the nervous system -- inducing effects like temporary schizophrenia, memory loss, heightened aggression, immobilizing depression, or fear -- was irresistibly attractive to Biopreparat's senior military scientists. After Popov's defection, the research continued."" This opens up the possiblity to do economic damage and change the culture all at once. Similar research has been done before: ""Thought versus feeling"", David Jones,  Nature  386, 770-770 (24 Apr 1997). When I left the US I was much disappointed about the drop in my salary, but I was also relieved that some of the excesses of consumerism didn't follow me here. Some of these things made me think sometimes the US economy thrives entirely on bullshit, mail in rebates come to mind or the internet bubble. Now if we  assume that the US economy thrives entirely on bullshit (it doesn't but movies needn't be accurate), removing the ability in people to spread bullshit should certainly hurt the economy, also it would change the culture I guess. Now you have a bunch of terrorists go ahead bribe a russian (we need stereotypes too) scientist into cooking up some virus to prevent people from bullshitting others. Those terrorists could be foreigners, if they are comming from some poor country they don't have to worry about the virus spreading since they won't have an economy to destroy anyway. 

Well there should be some opportunity to squeeze some comedy out of the virus spreading, used car salesmen who tell their customers that this car is a hunk of junk, new car salesmen who have to tell their customers  that their new car was specifically engineered to have its first defects right after the warranty period ends, politicians who have to tell the truth, well you can think of more.   If you want to add an extra twist you could describe how some guy in a basement discovers that a vaccine could be derived from a bacterium which lives on cow dung (how obvious). He could be some 15 year old geek whose parents have some particular dishonest job and who now eyes the character change in his parents with suspicion, and wants his old parents back or something like this. 

The problem is the the whole thing was meant to be scary and now became a comedy. I would prescribe some very deadpan humor, and maybe do it as a  black and white movie, and it must start out in a bathroom.   ",kt1023,2006-04-15 05:14:00

c53440,a000808,"I have an actual movie plot, not from an existing movie but rather from a screenplay I wrote nearly 10 years ago.  So yes, it's copyrighted but also available for any producer who's interested!  Here it is in a nutshell… Foreign terrorists -- frustrated at not being able to infiltrate American soil and launch a large-scale terrorist attack -- hire a domestic militia to do their bidding for a price.  The militia has their own reasons for wanting to topple the American government, so they are only too eager to assist by becoming ""terrorists-for-hire"". The terrorists have learned to breed a highly concentrated and deadly form of Ricin (a poisonous protein derived from castor beans).  They fill dozens of remote-controlled bombs with huge quantities of the genetically altered Ricin, then attach these bombs to weather balloons and launch them into the atmosphere. The jet stream is headed directly over Washington, D.C., and the terrorists begin making their demands or else they'll detonate the bombs remotely via an encrypted cell phone.  If the Air Force should attempt to shoot down the balloons, built-in altimeters will cause them to detonate during free-fall.  In either event, a cloud of invisible, deadly poison will be disseminated on the wind and kill anyone who inhales even an invisibly microscopic amount. The heros board a cargo plane and catch up to one of the balloons in order to capture it in flight.  They reel it into the cargo hold of the plane and seal it into a hyperbaric chamber that will artificially maintain a constant level of air pressure inside.  The bomb is then safely taken to a facility on the ground where they attempt to learn how to disarm it. They of course fail miserably at this task, with various tragedies occurring along the way.  Ultimately, their only hope is to obtain the encrypted cell phone that the head terrorist plans to use to detonate the bombs.  This leads to a dramatic show-down between our hero and the head terrorist, and, well, you can probably figure out how it all ends.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Bruce,   Having read the scary plots I miss something as they are all about the same – physical violence. There are worse issues to face. It's not too far fetched that we're sent 70 years back in time to the 1929 Depression where people starved and desperately started to listen to dangerous ""political religions"" creating WW2.  The successful mantras in Germany were related to the WW1 Piece in Versailles 1918 and subsequently a heavy attack against the monetary system - ruled by Taikoon Ivar Kreuger 1929-1932. This is not very difficult to repeat. Let's look into it: The terrorists don't hate common people but the System. Their attacks are made to scare people to stop their politicians in turn to open up for malicious religious take overs. If those fanatics, ( with or without scientific support by economical org. crime which wants to buy real estate and industries cheap when people no longer have access to cash ), use spywares – of the undetectable/non-ereaseable kinds of rootkits -  and when using botnet automated man-in-the-middle scenarios, the fanatics would be able to destroy our monetary system within six months. Firstly, Alice would NEVER again use her InternetBank if she got a popup frame telling her: “ Thank you Alice for using your bank account 123456 in your Online X-bank. Account is now empty. Welcome back after refill��?. Irrespectively of full banking coverage of the loss, she would not use it again. It's a Disgrace of Privacy to have an enemy in our computer. It's scary and ID-thefts can never be covered by the bank Secondly, Bob would never again use his credit card on the Internet if the similar message was popping up ��?Hi Bob. Thanks for giving us your VISA card 9876 5432 1012 3456 and other data. It's now for sale to $60 on the Internet and we will do our very best to open some new nice credits. We look fwd to see you soon again in e-commerce��?. Bob would never return to e-comm. Thirdly, regarding the InternetBank Security boxes. Those are manufactured by poor and easy bribed people in the Third World quite able to install some hidden “helpers��? into the algoritm for botnets and rootkits to match names and pwds to stolen keys. 
This can be made and it will cause a huge drainage of the Internetbanks.  It's no Uthopia that the world InternetBanks could loose hundreds of mlns of dollars around the clock and if closing the bank - the customers well flee to bank offices with depraved service. 
And the banks cannot simply leave Online services any longer. Turning point is passed. They are caught in their own development.  Who of the terrorists wouldn't like a catch of some extra $bln / week ? The crypto keys of those “security boxes��?are presently put into the std. algoritms outside the InternetBanks and probably not so very hard to steal either. I'm quite sure there are lists of the batches somewhere to steal. Somebody was able to hack and steal the ultimately protected database of CardSystems AZ for 30 mln credit card no:s in 2005. In this view it would not be very hard for them to steal some batch lists at those subcontractors processing the individual crypto keys automated into the certain numbered security boxes to be sent to the bank. Of course there are lists of this. However, I would be the very first guy to queue outside my bank to withdraw all possible cash of my assets in case this happens - or if a fraction of it happens meaning the  threat grows - and so will millions of us do as well. The borderline between demand and supply of cash will soon become a critical mass and we will see the equal situation as in Hong Kong in the 50-ties when bank of China more or less saved the enclave.  The globalization of economy will care for the impact, the DOW will fall like a stone in water and when passing 4,000 pts the Derivate Bomb will ignite. The top 3 US banks, sole,  have committed themselves in dangerous derivate undertakings presently exceeding +1.5 of TOTAL world economy (GNP). How big the global derivates' commitment  I don't dare to think of. No state or globally assembled Reserves can cover more than a fraction of this when time comes and we will have a new 1929 with scumbags purchasing highly valuable assets to a bargain. The criminal overload of sought after cash will even more reduce prices and the ""Glorious"" terrorists' promises will once more attract families with starving children. We are sitting ducks all of us!

c53460,a000808,"Call this plot ""Tank Men"". Strategically located around the country are fuel terminals. These terminals are owned and operated by various oil companies. The terminals contain tanks of all sizes that contain aviation fuel, gasoline, diesel, and other specialty fuels. These terminals are surronded by chain link fences and are generally in the countryside near big cities. Sometimes, they are right in the cities proper. Generally, the security at these terminals is very low or non-existent A group of terrorists buy an oil industry  reference map an locate each of the main terminals. Then an agent is assigned to each one. Each agent is given travel money, and a list of supplies to buy at a hardware store. The first is a pair of bolt cutters, the second is a pipe wrench, and the third is a box of roadside emergency flares. On the date of the attack, the agents cut the fence, approach each tank and lossen the bolts on the pipe flanges on the piping attaced to each tank at ground level so that fuel leaks into the dike surrounding each tank. After letting the dikes fill sufficiently, the agent strikes the flares and tosses them into the dikes. The resulting fires severely damage or destroy most of the tanks. No one is killed and the agents exit stage left. Since it takes about a year to rebuild each tank, all transportation in the country comes to a halt. The economy is severely disrupted and marshall law is enacted to keep the peace.",BJW,2006-04-15 09:32:00
c53461,a000808,"This on is perhaps a little closer to reality than most of the above.
If the terrorists really want to cause mass panic, they need to make the people of middle america feel unsafe. Take a town of a thousand or so somewhere in the heartland. Make sure it has a limited number of access points (say two, one for the highway coming in, one for the highway going out) and block them with semi's first thing in the morning. Wander through town just killing anyone you can get to, using conventional weapons. As soon as you are discovered, kill yourself with high explosives in the town hall.
That would pretty much cause the US to tear itself apart in a matter of days, because it can't be guarded against.   Of course, if you want to make it a movie and not a real terrorist attack you can mod it like this: The terrorist do kill a few people out of the gate, but herd most of them into the local high school (with the plan to blow them up at the end of all this). The local football hero and the science nerd (who is of course an incredibly beautiful girl that wears glasses and is unfashionable so she is picked on by everyone - probably played by Julia Styles...) manage to elude the terrorists. They manage to eliminate the terrorists one by one, but the main guy manages to trigger the timer on the bomb that is going to blow up the high school. Science nerd girl gets shot (not fatally) and football boy needs to disarm the bomb, using instructions from science nerd girl. He manages it with one second to spare.

It's ""obvious"" and the impact will dwarf those from any conventional terrorist attack. In fact, we often wondered why terrorists never attempted it. If a terrorist wanted to do lasting and significant damage to the US, all they need to do is target a series of telecom Central Offices in the financial district of New York (though targeting a number of COs in the Beltway might also have a chaotic effect on the entire nation). Basically, all of the commerce in the world passes through the stock exchanges. These exchanges in lower Manhattan (along with the Wall Street firms that funnel dollars into the exchanges) are connected to the outside world through no more than perhaps half a dozen COs. These COs are only minimally gaurded, with an officer at a desk. The SONET rings that collect the traffic can be taken down by destroying both COs on any working and protect path. The COs are obvious and not hide-able and publically documented. For added benefit, numerous cell towers could be destroyed as well, making even marginal backup very difficult. Actually, the biggest lasting impact from 911 was due to the destruction of a CO that existed in 4 WTC along with bringingthe big Verizon CO offline on West street. This CO was ""rebooted"" several days after 911, thus allowing the exchanges to return to the world, but a targeted approach could pull Wall Street offline for many weeks or months.

c53501,a000808,"BREAD & CIRCUSES: seriously impair either one and you'll pit the people against the authorities/government/leaders/etc. *** BREAD: Two main current vulnerabilities ... 1. People's (disinterested) reliance on opaque and technical inspection regimes for food safety, and
2. Poor and self-interested water management.  Either singly or as a combination of efforts ... a) Infiltrate the chain of inspection for a major food industry (e.g., beef and BSE, poultry and H5N1, etc.) from the lowest most hands-on and up to the level of authority where there's no personal inspection of product.When possible, coordinate efforts to falsify records, introduce or allow pathogens, poor hygiene, and foreign substances. If the manpower is available, infiltrate the animal services community to look out for (and acquire) ""wild"" samples of big-name bugs like BSE or H5N1 when they land onshore or pop-up on their own. Once covertly acquired, introduce into the food chain.
b) Again, this involves inflitrating the upstream inspection chain for the water supply. The communities (note plural) targeted should be small (preferably much smaller than a city) but affluent and/or tourist destinations near major population centres. The key is that several all over the country must be targeted simultaneously. Contamination must focus on lax/sabotaged inspection standards that do not prohibit industrial use or color the water but pose a long term (decades) threat to human health. Certain heavy metals (e.g., lead, mercury) in low concentrations have an especially profound effect over a long term. The devastation to such prominent communities should enhance the publicity of the problem and hopefully cause an over-reaction from government. As a bonus side effect, the lack of effect on industrial use should introduce some public/private sector tension as well.  Finally, the key to BREAD is NEVER TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE PROBLEMS. A naturally defensive bureaucracy will try to hide and surreptitiously solve the problems, plus a public prone to gossip will spread the anxiety (terror) fast enough. The combination will maintain an environment for the terrorists to work as long as possible. *** CIRCUSES: Sports and television ... c) Pick any of the large popular sports (e.g., little league baseball, kids soccer, etc.) that have a low barrier (cost, access, etc.) for child participation (and parent fanaticism). Infiltrate a small, mid-to-upper middle class community completely, i.e., start businesses, have families, etc. Concentrate on building a winning team in that sport and highly publicize (and covertly arrange) corporate sponsorship, including ""importing"" (i.e., moving the family) ringers. Make sure as much publicity and marketing of the team and, especially, the sponsorship angle, is done as an example to follow, i.e., make it as much as possible to the pro version. If the model catches on in other affluent communities, let it grow until the poorer people start to grumble about cost of access and equipment. Then arrange accidents and the commensurate lawsuits to ratchet up insurance costs to completely freeze out the poor. Example: minor hockey. d) More Janet Jackson. Well not really but more of the same. Infiltrate both sides of the media morality issue. Ratchet up the extremism in the debate by arranging more high profile ""nip slips""  type incidences and the outraged over-reaction to it. Try and stick to previously innocuous forms like kids shows (especially anything educational) and nature programs (to undermine science). Make sure to call in to AM radio, write letters to government (elected and non-elected), write letters to the editor, post to blogs, email talk shows, etc., from both sides of the issue. Ignore logic and play on emotionalism, morality (not ethics), (mythical) tradition and security (think of the children). From the other side emphasize money: size of the industry as a part of GDP, number of employees, and revenue. Hopefully (from the terrorist standpoint) this result in overtly biased legislation and lawsuits galore.

Their task is to create an on-board controller for a model helicopter, capable of taking off, moving through waypoints at set times and landing (lets not arise suspicion and it'll be useful for testing). Also the helicopter should be able to drop small relief packages.  Sell it as proof of concept, once generated you'll take it to venture capitalists to raise money for further dev and look into selling to miltary or anyone wishing to monitor an area. Lets be generous and set aside $250k for them for pay and parts and a small studio. Some knowledge of explosives will be needed, as the next stage is to create a nail-bomb, or ball-bearing bomb.  The explosives could be as simple as the mortar type fireworks, or something with more punch.  I'm sure there's enough info on the web to find a good middle ground. These explosives need to be rigged to be detonated upon impact.  The engineer hired should be able to help, a detonation is only an electric impulse, so could easily be explained as a shock-recovery module to be added to the helicopter (if the helicopter crashes it'll send a signal to whatever connected device).  Simply use the module on the explosive drop instead. Kill the coder(s) and engineer. Cost wise, a model helicopter capable of picking up 10-15kg will come in at about $6k, with all modifications and boards, lets estimate $10k per UAV.  For the terrorist event, lets hook up 10 UAV's for a total cost of $100k + a van to move them about.  Clearly mark the van as entertainment surveillance.

Attacking it directly is quite promising, for example by overloading the system. Not necessarily as a decoy, but perhaps even as the ""real"" target. Poor mother won't get an ambulance for sick child, as every one is already busy. Horror. Or call ambulances to fake-emergencies, killing the teams upon arival. Two terrorists should be able to handle an ambulance easly. Ambulances are afraid of going to emergencies, normal people fear that they won't get an ambulance in case of an emergency. Or use an ambulance to get to your target. Remember ""Eraser""? One attacker is in the building and collapses. Ambulance is in a hurry, guards don't check and bingo, terrorist-team is inside secure area, and lot's of bad cargo, too. - There are so many small vilages. Or even just a number of houses close together.... dark night, 30 armed and trained terrorists..... might even take some days till someone realises that some hicktown went missing. Of course, that violates the ""small teams""-rule. Movie-plot: terrorists attack hicktown. Middle of a dark night, they expect everyone to be sleeping. But the onyl computer-nerd is still awake, fighting with just tow lines of code... wouldn't hear anything, of course, but just in the right moment fetches a fresh coffee, thus hearing the sound when some terrorist steps on the dead branch next to the kitchen.....

Sorry guys. There is one way how to achieve this though, and I do not take credit for inventing it. Terrorists will infiltrate Gay & Lesbian Movement, legal fraternity and bank world.  They will promote homosexuality. Firstly as an alternative, later as desirable and towards the end as compulsory. The last remains of heterosexual families will be broken up by infiltrated legal bodies, parents will be prevented from educating their children and at the schools children will be taught how to divorce their parents. The banks will abolish gold equity in US currency, so they can print money and lend it at high interest to the government whenever it runs of funds. This way they will control economy and also make sure, that they never run out of needed cash. The end result: We will be all gay and lesbians, and unless science develops some other ways of reproduction, our civilization will disappear within a few generations. OK, it is not a short-time solution, and would not make a good movie-plot. What’s more, this scenario is not very original and I believe, that it has already started. But it is one which works.

Once inside the USA, they begin to act like Mexican immigrants, and take jobs as construction workers.  Forged documents, stolen SSN's, the works.  They've even practiced running away whenever they hear someone shout ""La Migra!"" Rather than try to prevent completion, the group plans to let the towers be finished and then blow them up again, to punish the Americans' arrogance.  One of them carries a picture of his little sister, who was killed during the Iraq war as his family held out in Fallujah. The terrorists pack explosives around the main beams just before covering them with drywall, plaster and lathe, whatever they use in big construction.  Repeat for multiple floors.  Wires run the length of the beams, into the basement, to enable detonation. Going back to la migra, have this happen at least once during the movie, where INS comes to the job site, and the terrorists play the part, running away.  But it almost scuttles the entire operation as one guy leaves wires hanging in plain view.  The operation is saved because the *entire* crew ran when the INS showed up, so nobody was left to see the wires.  When the crew returns, Mohammed (the leader) beats the living s*** out of Abdullah for leaving the wires exposed. Fast forward.  The towers are finished, and there's a huge ceremony with the President, a bunch of millionaries, and lots of balloons, mom, and apple pie.  People in the audience at the ceremony stand and spontaneously sing ""God Bless America.""  The sun comes out from behind the clouds, and the glint off the newly finished buildings almost blinds the crowd. As people go to work on the first day in the new towers, the terrorists prepare the detonators.  Working in the basement of the building, they connect the hundred or so wires for all the charges in the building.  The security guard at the front desk thinks it's strange the a bunch of construction workers are coming into the building, after all, it's finished.  He checks it out, sees what's happening, and the plot is stopped.  Yay, hero. The bombs are defused, and the government starts instituting mandatory background checks for all construction workers.  By the end of the movie, every construction worker has a barcode tattooed on his arm, plus an implanted RFID chip.  To enter or exit the job site, the RFID is scanned, the barcode is scanned, the worker puts his thumb on a fingerprint reader, and he puts his eye up to an iris scanner.

c53589,a000808,"Plot premise: on a random Saturday afternoon, a single suicide bomber explodes emself in a crowded shopping centre in Albuquerque.  The next Saturday, same thing in a movie theatre in Boston.  The next Saturday, a restaurant in Claremont.  The next Saturday panic ensues as the public evacuates from Daly City, Denver, Dover, Daytona Beach, etc., and then a bomber explodes emself on a train full of people evacuating from Detroit.  Iterate.  Every Saturday panic ensues in 4% of the towns and cities in the US, and ten or twenty people get blown up somewhere in the affected area.  Disruption caused is massively disproportionate to the effort expended.  The methodology is good until the public figure out that they're better off taking their chances (yeah, right). Plot twist: in week 5 police following links from earlier bombers foil a lone bomber targeting Elmira, only for another one to hit El Paso.  The following week there are attacks in Fredericksburg, Flint, and Fort Worth.  The coordination required on the part of the terrorists is so minimal that copycats can keep the pattern going without any direct communication with the original instigators: all the coordination necessary was supplied by the news reporting of the first three attacks (which established the pattern). I think it'd be an effective terrorist tactic, and also a good premise for a movie.  It's not such a good example of the movie-plot-threat syndrome though: the pattern has to get established before people have the vague threat to respond to.",Zefram,2006-04-16 08:30:00

The 20/30 unskilled men are divided into 2-men teams and assigned to 10-15 key PEPSI/Coke export facilities.

Then they add to the materials a highly toxic substance, may be some rat poison or anything that can be easily obtained and that causes instant human death. This means, that millions of PEPSI/Coke products that will be manufactured in foreign countries will be deadly. This will cause millions of deaths world-wide leading to mass-boycotting of everything American and possibly a military reaction from some country.

c53593,a000808,"BIRD FLU. Recombining H5N1 with standard human flu. Step 1) Get one member of your suicide team to catch a big nasty flu (easy to do in wintertime, you just have to ride the NYC, or any major city's subway at peak hours. Step 2) Once he's infected, take half his blood and store in cold room, to have a large amount of infected blood with normal human flu. Step 3) Find a place where bird flu is rampant and uncontrolled (Chinese or Turkish countryside, sub-saharian Africa). Send a couple of members of your suicide team to play with dead birds and chew their excrements until they've caught the bird flu. Repeat blood collecting procedure. Step 4) inocculate half of your team with BOTH strands of flu. You goal is to get the two strands of flu to recombine inside the sick men's bodies in order to get a mutated virus that is as deadly as the H5N1, and can spread from human to human as easily as a standard cold. Step 5) For each infected subject, as soon as his flu starts, collect blood, label the sample, and send him in some large citie with a subway anywhere in the world (or just in America, depending on your prefences). Have your bio-terrorists ride the subway all day long, and breathe in people's faces as much as possible (the Tokyo subway in particular is a great place for that !) Step 6) Watch where a bird flu epidemic breaks out. You know the guy you sent there was carrying a re-combined Human-Bird Flu strand. Infect all of your remaining team with his infected blood and scatter them on subways all over the free world.
(If you don't get any of your bearers to produce a recombined flu, hire a new team and start the process again from step 4 and/or try with a different strand of human flu.)  Once the recombined Human-contagious bird flu is out, you've done it ! Get enough people on subways and in airplanes, and pretty soon the whole western world will be sneezing to death. Voila ! Now record your little video, send it to Al-Jazeera and CNN, inoculate yourself, and go on your final road-trip across the USA, kissing as many people as you can along the way, and finally die a glorious flu ! Everyone will stay home, terrified of the virus. You've basically frozen the whole western economy for at least a whole winter season, and if you're lucky you get to cause approximately 250 million casualties worldwide. Osama will be proud of you ! PS : instead of a team of human virus incubators, you can go for pigs. Once your pigs develop a contagious strand of the bird flu, use their blood to infect your human bio-bombs. Human and pigs share a great number of diseases, including the flu, so the scheme should work just as well, and it will definitely be easier to hire large teams of pigs rather than humans to inoculate with H5N1 infected blood. The one proviso is : if you're an Al-Qaeda terrorist, you might feel religiously uncomfortable with injecting yourslf with pig blood. Ah, Shucks !

DHS can't possibly watch all of the local restuarants, high schools, community colleges, and stores in towns of, say, 2000 or so population.

Once inside, the passwords to the networks are usually not kept secret enough and even when they are, they often can be cracked/hacked/sniffed or exchanged for sandwiches. With the network access, send a quick spreading, bios wiping worm from inside the firewall. A malicious variation of the Morris worm would be just the ticket. Very small number of companies still use air-gap; usually somewhere there is an ftp connection with the password conviniently saved as reversable hash. And the funds can be spent on paying the worm writers. That's a lot of funds for that purpose.

- Cause terror
- Make Americans notice
- Inflict lasting economic damage on US
- Change the political landscape, or the culture.     How's this:
- The simplicity of napalm production is (as has been pointed out earlier) fairly simple.
- Target: 10-15 Shopping malls
- When: Day after Thanksgiving
- Specifics: have each ""team"" produce as many ""napalm canisters"" (something on the order of a soda can in size, with either a timer, or a radio controlled detonation).
- Detectability?  Well, there are very few detectors for parking lots.      Scenario: The teams distribute the canisters under as many vehicles in the parking lot as possible.  Set to explode in waves.  The second wave of explosions is set to go off in 20-30 minutes after the first, so the safety teams - police and firemen and such, have had time to show up. Intent: the primary explosions will cause panic, the secondary explosions will cause further panic, the long term economic impact will be multi-faceted
1. People will be afraid to shop in malls,
2. The insurance rejections (""oh, I'm so sorry, this was due to a terrorist act, and is therefor not covered"".)  The fact that everyone who's transportation is now ruined, and yet still be responsible for paying off the existing loans should be huge.

c53601,a000808,"Some of the ideas I read here are good terrorism or good movie plots, but not really good movie plot threats. Some requirements are (imho):
1) The threat itself should already cause a scare, not really needing execution of the plan.
2) A good movie plot threat can be defended against in some cumbersome or costly way.
3) Politicians should be demanding that this defense be put in place at any cost, after hearing of the threat.    Mr. Schneier hasn't supplied a definition of ""movie plot threats"", but that is what I understand from his use of the phrase. So here's an example that could do the above (though I don't think it's good enough myself):
Simultaneous destruction of multiple branches of the big californian aqueducts, with the goal of cutting off the water supply to eg. LA.
Now a politician, hearing of this, might  want to jump on the anti-terror  bandwagon (again) and clamor for camera surveillance on the aqueduct, with one camera every 100 yds to protect the californian way of life.  He could call his motion the Act Protecting Our Californian Aqueducts Leaving Innocent People Safe  (APOCALIPS). Next a group of citizens might form the Volunteer Aqueduct Patrol On Rollerblades (VAPOR) making sure the bad guys don't simply ignore the cameras. ( You need a good acronym to get anywhere, hence the rollerblades :P )

A little snooping and a little cash will allow you to find out who plans the routes for the trucks, as well as information on the truck itself such as any trackers on it. 4) You now need the man who plans the routes in the palm of your hand.  Kidnap his family, if he doesn’t give you the route / if he tells the authorities his family dies, if he does what you say he gets to see them again and $75,000 for is help.  After he gives the route have him reunited with his family in some remote place, kill them all so that they can’t talk.  While the informer is being taken care of 15-20 heavily armed terrorists jack the truck, disable any tracking devices, and make off with it. 5) There need to be two-four small trucks waiting, fertilizer bombs already placed inside.  Fill the rest with your nuclear waste (Cs-137, I-131 are the best).  The bomb should be at the bottom of the truck and the waste placed above it, so as to blow the material upward.  Lining the top of the truck with lead might be a prudent move, especially in a movie setting showing that for all of our technology we can’t see everything (a decent layer of lead will not allow the satellites to detect the radiation).  Have another four to six cars with fertilizer bombs in them but no nuclear waste. 6) Drive the trucks into NYC, evenly spaced through the metropolis.  Put your car bombs on bridges/tunnels leading out of NYC.  You don’t need to hit every one, but just enough to create a bottleneck of terrific proportions, of course hitting every one would be the optimum.  Five minutes after blowing the bridges and the tunnels the trucks blow.  Millions are trapped in NYC being contaminated by radioactive materials which will be absorbed into their bones and thyroid gland, as well as be spread through the entire city proper.  The inhabitants are seriously ill/dead and NYC is uninhabitable.  Game Over. This plan would make a good movie - lots of action and drama.  Additionally it would be terrifying to see that an entire city could be laid to waste with the materials acquirable within the United States, bypassing our boarder patrols and airport security.  The economic impact would be nearly indescribable as NYC would be out of commission for years, and depending on the dispersion and type of waste that is used segments might be unrecoverable.  Politically there would be none who are spared the wrath of the people, the internal security repercussions would be dire as people would offer their personal freedoms up on a silver platter for a little more of a promise that this would not happen again, the very definition of a successful terrorist attack.

c53620,a000808,"1) Attach large, homemade, flux compression devices/e-bombs to hot-air or weather balloons. Since the e-bomb is like a glorified pipe bomb with a broadcasting short circuit, they would be relatively cheap to make, while the elevation of the balloon allows for the enhancement of the EMP effect. 2) Following Bruce Simpson's lead, terrorists produce a DIY cruise missile for $5,000 using off-the-shelf components for GPS and avionics and a pulse jet engine similar to a V1 buzz bomb. While the Simpson missile design has an payload 10-15kg (enough for bioweapon dispersal), well say a sizable explosive version can be produced for $10,000. Either way, with the $500k limit, this produces around 50-100 cruise missiles. Unleash these things during rush hour on the major throughfares and highways of major cities, especially places that gridlock easily. The first wave will be low flying and the composite airframe would be technically invisible to radar, so this would come without warning. This would produce a sizable amount of casualties and panic, especially as reports flow into other time zones. A second wave on traffic caused by the first wave would be even more effective at inducing panic and causing casualties, although would be more detectable and less likely to succeed if the military turns off civie GPS. Bonus points for structure hitting elevated freeways and collapsing them. 3) Spread news about a military dissatisfaction with the President, Congress, and the civilian leadership at the Pentagon. With $500k, buy American uniforms and weapons to supply at least two companies of soldiers (you might even get battalion strength with that price). Infiltrate and replace the Marine Honor Guard in the White House (if this an actual coup, easy enough). Deploy your two companies on the capitol grounds and the White House. Send a smaller detachment to handle the vice president and any other in line for succession, under the guise of ""protection"". By now, the media is already seeing this and, knowing the rumors of a coup de'tat, believe these manuevers are THE coup.

What if we multiply that by thirty and add in some basic route planning?  Split the team up among 4 or 5 states and have them travel their routes, setting fires along the way.  Just have them keep going until they get caught.  If you plan things well, the fires will overlap and reinforce each other.  Even if most of the fires don't amount to much even 4 or 5 really big fires will disrupt lives, businesses, cause a lot of property damage and cost a lot of money.  This is the ""Blair Witch""  concept - a huge return for a minimal investment.  You could probably pull this off for well under 100k. Expensive and Difficult:  Break your 30 people into 7 teams.  Each is sent to different cities across the country: LA, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Houston, Chicago, Atlanta and Boston.  Each team selects 2 targets.  Each team spend the bulk of their time building 2 Oklahoma City style truck bombs.  Near the appointed date, each team acquires a small RV and a large white cargo van.  The van is outfitted with flashing lights and painted to look like an ambulance (doesn't have to be perfect).  On the appointed date and time, all vehicles are loaded with explosives.  The RV is driven to each team's targe #1 - a large hotel (7-10 stories, hundreds of rooms).  The RV can be driven right up to the building and detonated.  Imagine 7 large hotels full of guests suddenly looking like the Murrah building. Ten minutes later, the ""ambulance"" rolls against target #2 - a major hospital.  You want to time this so the ""ambulance"" arrives after the attack is public but before the real emergency vehicles start showing up.  Same plan - use the vehicle's camouflage to allow it to drive right up to the building and take out the emergency room.

c53634,a000808,"Christmas Crash Beginning: A small group of hardened eco-terrorists develop a plan to crash the american economy. 30 or so infiltrate companies supplying shopping malls with goods all over america. At the beginning of the intense shopping period leading up to Christmas, they plant multiple timed explosives in different stores all over America (the non-localised attacks are important). At the beginning of the shopping period, they detinate several of these, killing dozens of shoppers in different parts of the country, as they purchase their christmas gifts. Targets include toy stores, and electronics retailers, as well as other locations with intensive turnover during the christmas period. Buildup: This causes nationwide panic, and consumption drops as consumers shy away from shopping malls and high streets. This is further bolstered by more explosions, further detering those still taking the risk to get their kids action figures. Neither the government, nor the retail industry knows how to cope, there being no way of screening products on a nationwide scale. Although they have some success finding and defusing some devices, and even capture a few of the terrorist cell, the whole christmas consumption machine comes to a halt. Sales plummet, and the lowest turnover of any christmas in decades hits the economy like a sledge hammer, revealing its dependence on the yearly orgy of consumption. By the time the authorities figure out the plan it is too late. Calls for consumers to go out and shop (echoing post-911) are viewed as callous and greedy, and greeted as hostile. Nor can the authorities plead with the public on the basis of how essential christmas consumption is to the economy, for the more this appears in the media, the worse overall investor confidence becomes. Climax: In mid december, despite the headway being made by the investigation into the terrorist cell, the penny begins to drop, and investors start dumping stock like its going out of fashion. The economy collapses as confidence, along with share prices, goes through the floor. The leaders of the terrorist cell are apprehended on christmas day, in a major raid, but it is already too late. China and Japan begin dumping dollars, as they see that propping up the already huge (US$ 8 trillion) US national debt is no longer viable, as the country will not be buying exports at a worthwhile rate. Epilogue: Between chrismas day and new year, the biggest recession since the 1929 crash unfolds, and with burgeoning consumer debt, and an already large wealth divide, chaos ensues. This story should be told from several angles, firstly, the terrorist cell, giving their motivations and showing how they prepare and execute the operation, and then their attempts to avoid capture; secondly, from the point of view of the government and those reponsible for dealing with the crisis and trying to track down the terrorists (Homeland Security/FBI and probably some reference to the President and so on); thirdly, from the point of view of an economics professor and his family, trying to get by over the christmas period (Should probably begin with him trying to buy gifts, and slowly develop with him realizing the consequences of the attacks before they happen, thus having the moral dilemma of whether to warn others, or get in as good a position for recession as he can).

c53636,a000808,"TRUE TERROR This is actually something I talk about often now, specifically the relation between ineffective anti-terrorism/security ""precautions"" and actual methods to induce true terror. True terrorism must tap the latent fear in every individual that their common daily life is threatened. This does NOT involve grandiose plans like Super Bowl bombs or even WTC attacks. (While moved, how many people in rural America truly feared for the lives after 9/11? None.) TRUE terror must be indiscriminate and universal. The method for this (one which I can't believe terrorists haven't implemented yet in America) is a similar model to the DC snipings yet involving numerous more snipers. The effect of a single sniper almost crippled DC. Save your $500,000 in supplies and use it to recruit more snipers.  Imagine the paralyzation of America if 100 random killings a day peppered across the US were suddenly reported. It's a simple plan: Dispatch roving snipers throughout America with orders to make random kills at gas stations, parks, Wal-Marts, churches, schools, etc. Equipped with even normal hunting rifles, these inconspicuous mobile units could leisurely make multiple hits within a town/city in a single day before moving on. As with the DC sniper, the method of attack (silent and distant) increases their potency and prolongs their ""career."" Someone crumpling to the ground at a gas station doesn't attrack attention to the unmarked car silently driving the other direction. These independent units have no complex needs or orders and don't even require training. If captured, no information beyond the obvious (snipers are randomly killing common people throughout America) could be extracted from them. THIS would truly change the landscape of America.

c53647,a000808,"Here's an easy way to take out an entire brigade in Iraq without ever having to set foot in the desert.... Well, here's one that actually scared the bejesus out of a former military commander I once worked with.  
Basically, you don't go after a target in America.  You go after the poorly guarded Army installations in Europe (USAREUR).  For years all these bases were open to the general public to drive right onto until 1995-1996.  So by now they have ALL been ""mapped"" by every single intelligence organization on the planet. Every single installation has one weak point:  communications.  Only ONE building on every installation houses the computer network backbone and telephone switch for that installation and the surrounding area. All it would take is a dedicated team of 5-10 people to easily sneak in to one that houses a brigade headquarters and plant a series of bombs.  Since Germany has a large Turkish population, no one notices ""swarthy"" individuals anymore.  The first one to take out would be the central communications building which is usually NEVER heavily guarded and pretty easy to get into with a crowbar.  Take out communications and the military response dies or at least slows to a crawl.  That then leaves the terrorists free to attack the poorly guarded housing areas since all attention would be on the bombs on the main post, not the housing areas surrounding it.  You can take out a couple out housing areas killing mostly women and children that way. Since the majority of soliders are in Iraq, you can do this at will to almost every single installation since they would have to spend money they don't have to hire on extra guards that will just be poorly trained civilians anyway. Panic would ensue.  Soldiers deployed downrange would be instantly demoralized and fighting with their first sergeants and commanders to go back to Europe.  And with all the deaths, the soldiers would have to come back to arrange funereals, etc. The manpower issues resulting from the lack of soldiers would make the entire brigade ineffective. I have others, but they scare even me so I never repeat them to anyone.  Basically, you take the years of training the Army gave you and apply it against itself.

For maximum disruption, it wouldn't take more than a few mylar balloons, perhaps in a net of thing-guage copper wire released in a synchronized fashion, into some of the major transmission lines, to take out power over large chunks of the US.  The movie would, of course, focus on a lone employee of some power company, who argues just this vulnerability, as we see the terrorists setting up exactly for just this occassion.  And then it's a race to repair the lines, while patrolling the others. In cinematic fashion, the repair teams would come under fire from terrorists there just for that purpose. Now, for maximum publicity, for cinematic purposes, it's hard to imagine a better symbol of America than Disneyland.  The first bombing happens at EuroDisney.  The next happens at DisneyTokyo.  But when suicide bombers go after Disneyland, taking out ""Small World"", ""The Matterhorn"" and other rides, and then issue their demands, the plot focuses on Disney World, showing how the terrorists plan on getting in, just in case, and showing the civil reaction to just such a thing.  In the meantime, it's likely that Disneyworld is shut down for a period of time, causing a great deal of disruption to the Orlando area economy, and various ripple effects, not just to Disney, but to the market in general.  In fact, much of the Disneyland scenario doesn't even need to take place inside the park; a car bomb in the parking lot would be enough.  But it's just not cinematic enough for my tastes.

Suddenly more people start dying, the only connections being blond hair and blue eyes. They eventually realize that a virus has been fused to the children's dna, and have to put them into isolation. By now however, it is to late, the virus the children are carrying has spread, and begins killing the most skilled workers of both europe and america, and it's source is hard to diagnose. Blond haired, blue eye'd people are quartined in mass numbers. The US government suddenly is faced with a work shortage, and because of their 6 month abuse of other countries sovreignty, find themselves with no charity. Because the virus only kills blond hair and blue eye'd children, most of the world figures themselves safe, and demand money for replacing the science and technology that is needed to find a cure. This begins the battle of philosophy within the US. With limited resources, they have to choose carefully on whether it is worth more to them to find a cure, or whether it will be better to find those responsible and punish them, in the hopes that they had created a cure. A deeper conspircy runs through the entire episode, as we find evidence that certain pharmaceutical companies had been donating money to off shore research in genetic manipulation. Further, they had been amassing offshore labs of every virus known to affect humans, and patenting all know cures to them. Through the long and ambigious chain of command, it is discovered that their money and research had gone into using the children as research subjects, and to consequently using one of the viruses in those storehouse.
We find out later that some of the unscrupulous people in big pharma had decided they needed another viral epidemic, but unwittingly allowed the terrorists to create one beyond their means to cure, and with the specificity of attacking only blond hair and blue eyes.  Facing a shortage of cash, and people willing outside the US to help us find a cure, they have to decide whether it would be better to punish the perpetrators on down the line, or to find a cure for their own selves. Billions of dollars would need to be poured into both efforts, and denying one effort money will likely cause its goal to be unfinished. So the people left in charge, of mixed race and descents, have to decide if it would be better to punish those that have created this racist virus, or whether they should try to find a cure for it. Ultimately, it was created/funded by the same racist characteristics that it attacks, specificly white people. Now that few white people are in power, now that the paradigm of race has shifted drasticly, what do we do? We give up on trying to find the hands that perverted the mind, and we search for a cure, accepting that regardless of the power structure before, we must accept that a cure to an illness is better than the revenge that might never bring that cure. That guns are created long before bullet proof vests. Simply because they created the virus does not mean they created a cure, or that it even has an easy to find cure. As for the stipulations about 500k and a few untrained people, those are rather ignoble stipulations. We know the terrorists are skilled, and we know they're funded by alot more money than simply 500k. A viral attack, on specific genetics is coming closer to reality, and the tools to experiment with such a thing. Alternately, it might make sense to kill several of the children who are never found, and save of course the parents that brought them in this world. The hero/scientist would be this person, trying to persuade the commanders/president, to fund more research, rather than military expenditures and black ops to find the perpetrators. Ultimately, the terrorists are never caught, big pharma is found to have funded all the equipment, lab and so forth that the terrorists had access to. The virus itself was not created by man, but big pharma kept it to itself. The terrorists used the children to inflict them, and the children could of course die, it doesn't matter depending on how the plot flows. So the guilty party could be said to be big pharma, but they did not specificly do the deed, but they created the incubator for the misdeeds of others, so thats why you could concievably only need 500000 to do all this. This is the ultimate parallel between viruses, and terrorists, people and the incubation of hate and terrorist. That the symptoms of the diease is not the disease itself, represented by the racist aspect of the disease. ",cy,2006-04-16 18:02:00

c53673,a000808,"This scenario requires only one or two people and a minimum outlay of funds (access to explosives) First you need a remotely accessible detonation mechanism. A remote vehicle assistance service would work nicely since it is tied to a GPS locator system and has the capability to unlock the doors of a car remotely. As this capability is rarely used the chance of a premature detonation is limited but if it happens it still meets the requirement of infusion of terror. Second you need an explosive device that can be remotely triggered. Air bags are readily available and if repacked with an explosive charge would provide an excellent mechanism for mobile destruction. The doctored airbags are installed either by a factory worker or even better at several service locations that have access to many different makes and models. The remote door-unlock mechanism from the remote assistance module is cross-wired into the airbag. The car license/serial number information is made available to an operator inside the dispatcher’s office and when the car is driven to an appropriate location, monitored by the GPS, it can be detonated remotely by the operator. If there is no inside operator in collusion then the person who installed the airbag they can call in the door unlock request using the credentials found in the car during the airbag repair. These cars could be dormant for months before activation. Four or five cars could be detonated before the information was corroborated or a pattern was noticed. Even so it could be very difficult to identify where the remaining explosives were located and they would also detonate in the event of an impact. The terror factor and financial costs of tracing down the remaining airbags would be significant. Who would want to drive their car to the dealer to have it checked once it was known that there was a possibility of the car exploding? For a very low cost option why not just install explosive airbags in random cars and wait for a few to explode then make it known that there are more. Again the terror comes from wondering if you have one. Enough randomness in the deployment and make of car would require the on-site inspection of every new and used car in North America. Car interiors do get hot so possibly a winter activity if the explosive compound is heat sensitive then again as long as it makes it past the deployment timeline it doesn't matter. ",P.

Add in a healthy does of Christian bias to finance and there's an easy target for terrorism.

The attack would have to employ something with potential to strike without warning (the threat of blowing up isn't going to work like it might with a plane). Possible solutions could include biological warfare agents, poisoned items, or -- dare I suggest it -- poisoned creatures randomly released. The scenario needs to work out so that after hearing about the large scale attack, you worry that it's at least possible that the same thing might happen to you if you are at this place. Scenario 1: Random high-demand consumable items throughout the stores are poisoned -- aspirin, ice cream, gum, baby formula. As items are purchased and consumed people start dying over the course of the month -- no one item can be isolated and recalled and to complicate matters -- different stores have different target items making quarantine impossible. The stores have to shut down and begin a major investigation -- while more deaths occur. This could be pulled off with unskilled workers with very little startup (they are working there already). 30 men get entry level jobs at Wal-mart doing any variety of stocking jobs which put them in unsupervised contact to a large variety of consumables.

Aside from a few asides, none of you folk (who are presumably interested mainly in crypto, since you're on Bruce's site) have considered information as a viable terror target. MP1: for $500k, steal the recipe for Coke, in a way that makes it easy to prove it *is* the real recipe (hence the huge cost involved). Chaos ensues, as grey-market factories around the world flood the market with cheap Coke clones. One of the mainstays of the american way is destroyed. MP2: Wait for huge-a$$ natural disaster, while training and funding a network of disgruntled out of work programmers and engineers whose jobs got outsourced. When the catastrophe ensues, crapflood 911 lines nationwide, DDoS the servers of local and state authorities, jam all radio frequencies in the affected area, fsck with comms satellites if possible, cut a few phone wires and blow up exchanges if you're feeling feisty. Document the whole operation and feed it live on the interweb as the humanitarian catastrophe unfolds. Erm. no... wait... this is not useful, as the FEMA has already been proved ineffective by Katrina. No need to kick a dead horse. MP3: Steal/buy the source code to all Microsoft products, distribute, watch in glee as microsoft stock crumbles, taking the stock market with it. Ok, now on to the hardline threats: MP5: Buy an unemployed ex-Biopreparat scientist for 300k, a moderate lab for 50-80k. Not top-notch, but enough to create a species of yeast which does not excrete ethyl alcohol, but methyl, while carrying and spreading around the very retrovirus which effected the mutation. Use the rest of the money to infect the stocks of the main yeast producers. The nation's supply of cheap beer dwindles and social chaos ensues as importing yeast is not an option under quarantine, the prices of chipwood, beet and grain skyrocket as the demand for chemically-produced alcohol soars. MP6: Use your money to help a couple sleeper agents get jobs as air traffic controllers in a metro area, train one pilot and 3-4 goons. Create a convincing threat of a new 9-11 by hijacking an empty but fueled plane on a runway somewhere and spreading FUD, then, when the order to ground all aircraft comes, truly re-enact 9-11 by mis-directing ALL of the dozens of aircraft assigned to each agent. MP7: Scariest of all, and hence best kept for last. On a really hot summer, break into a low-grade radioactive waste storage facility and steal stuff, or else hijack a truckful. Build a dirty bomb using this low-grade waste and ammonia. Plant bomb in a large, flammable forest, just off the coast. Launch a rocket (high and bigh enough for it to be tracked on the defense radar net) from a decomissioned oil rig towards said forest and the awaiting dirty bomb. Detonate bomb when  rocket falls under radar altitude, thus igniting a massive, slightly radioactive firestorm. Use the rest of your budget to sell the incident to the media as ""an attack with a theater-range tactical nuclear missile against the US soil, perpetrated by an Iranian Kilo-class submarine operating from the cover of a decomissioned oilrig"". Pin the conspicuous lack of casualties on bad targeting and wrong detonating altitude, inflame the public opinion in the immediate aftermath so much that the only option for the president to remain in power is to nuke Iran.

They are standing just off the airport property. At each location the terrorists have a terrorist buddy film it, and they mail the videotape to a local news affiliate. This is followed by a released statement that if all the prisoners being held in (fill in the blank with a prison with lots of terrorists) are released, they'll quit shooting down planes. No need to shoot down another plane though. The best time would be the day before Thanksgiving, stranding thousands and thousands of passengers. All planes are grounded, and no one wants to fly.

c53760,a000808,"Bruce, I think you're being far too generous in your requirements.  In order to inspire real fear in Americans, I think it suffices to demonstrate the number and diversity of very soft targets, throughout the US.  Here's how I would use my staff and money to do it: -- Scatter the 20-30 personnel widely across the country: 1-5 in several major metropolitan areas, but mostly in smaller and more rural communities. -- Arm each operative with both automatic weaponry and a reasonably large explosive device.  (These can be mostly procured within the U.S., but the explosives in particular may need to be smuggled in through Mexico) -- Allow each operative a week or so to survey targets: Schools, popular shopping venues (Walmart is particularly symbolic), local government buildings. -- Begin operations: Over the course of a few weeks or months, operatives carry out attacks on their selected targets.  
-- ** These need not be sophisticated attacks: A single attacker could likely kill many people just by arriving at a target and opening fire (especially in rural areas, where police are farther away).  
-- ** The attacks should be spread over time so that every ""sigh of relief"" is followed by another wave of attacks.
-- ** The attacks should appear coordinated; e.g. two schools are attacked at the same time, on the same day.    This operation wouldn't cause the mass casualties envisioned by some other posters, but over the weeks or months it would be in progress, it would create tremendous and thorough fear throughout the American populace: People would be afraid to go to school, to the mall, or to the post office.  And it would be pretty cheap: Unskilled operative can live cheaply until they attack, and plenty of armaments can be procured with the remaining cash.  The only remaining expense is for communication, which can be had virtually for free using secretive techniques on the Internet.  ",bifurcation,2006-04-17 09:11:00
c53761,a000808,"Hi Bruce: I've been reading cryptogram for years.  You are always thoughtful and informative.  This is a great idea for a contest - here's my entry: Terrorists lace some twenty thousand $20 bills with a ""time-released biotoxin"".  In a dastardly point of story development it is noted that only the *new* twenties have been tainted, thereby ensuring that our citizens natural fascination with currency design turns deadly! The ""Big Island"" of Hawaii is identified as the target for the dispersal of the deadly dollars, the evil theory being that the money will mostly stay within the boundaries of the island through normal trade and commerce. So, the poison paper starts flowing into the island in manners undetected - shipped to PO boxes, old and abandoned houses; placed between the pages of the bible carried by overseas ""missionaries"", stuffed into a crate-load of children's birthday pinatas, etc. After identifying some ""chatter"" indicating that a terrorist incident is to happen in the South Pacific, the Feds decide that they need to bring in an expert.  So, Tom Selleck reprises his role as Magnum, this time in consultation with the FBI, CIA, and Department of Homeland Security.  Magnum receives vague but helpful information from his colorful local contacts on the street: ""something big from overseas"", ""many people will die"", ""Yuppie Meal Ticket"" (slang for a $20 bill). People begin to perish - an old woman collapses after passing a donation to the receiving basket at her church; an ice cream truck driver is found slumped over face-first in a tub of orange sherbet; a teller at a race-track betting cage suffocates after inhaling her own tongue. At command central, pinpoints on a map indicate the seemingly random nature of these deaths.  But something seems to bind these people together in their doom....  But what?  What!!???? Oh, for the love of all that is holy.  It's the money, the money!!!!!! A joint coalition of retired presidents is formed to come up with a plan.   The ""Dead Presidents Society"" draws on it's influence in politics, business, and industry.   But what can be done? When all seems lost and the island is on the brink of catastrophe executives at WalMart step forward with a plan so crazy that it just might work.   Sterile, controlled trading posts are created so that people can dump their tainted cash for goods.  ""Take all the cash you've got, every cent, and spend, spend, spend like your life depends on it, because indeed it does..."", the retired Surgeon General C. Everett Koop emplores the populace on television, radio, and from leaflets dropped from the sky. And spend they do.  In a moment of patriotism and American gumpsion the people of Hawaii come together and drain their wallets.  The heavily fortified PX's provide them with wide-screen TV's, cleaning products, underwear, and most of all, peace of mind. In the end it is capitalism and consumerism which are the destroyers of evil, confirming a deep truth that all Americans share within their souls.  Once again, all is right in the world.

c53767,a000808,"This one would take time to build up but would be very cost-effective in terms of political power gained for your 500K dollars. A team of operatives obtains a large amount of Sodium Azide, an aggressively toxic chemical mainly used in car airbags but also airplane escape chutes and other explosive devices. It is evil stuff, water-soluble, and a couple of grams is easily fatal. If possible the collection of this material could be done by interception of shipments to legitimate users such as car manufacturers but in the extreme a usable quantity could be gathered from junkyards etc. A signed message is then broadcast, probably into an internet medium such as Usenet. It doesn't matter that not many people will see it initially. The message warns that the Brotherhood of Peaceful Freedom will produce some medium-nasty event at some particular place at some particular time. Everyone laughs at the spamming nutjobs but you do actually carry out the threat, for example it should be relatively easy to torch a previously-identified petrol filling station in an urban area. You rinse and repeat until your credibility is enormous and a large number of people are on the lookout for whatever you broadcast next and they tell their friends and the press and so on. Then you warn of the first severely-nasty event, an amount of sodium azide will be released into shopping mall X. The mall is cleared but you ensure plenty is found and if possible some people poisoned. To evade security you could plant your stuff before publishing the message. After a few more of these you could do whatever you liked, for example having the superbowl canceled would be no problem if you convinced people that they were in for a faceful of deadly poison if they attended. Alternatively, assuming some securely anonymous way of negotiating with a government (insert snake-oil quantum-encrypted satellite phone here) you could potentially collect a few billion in ransom.

c53772,a000808,"Let's call this one ""Trucker tarbaby."" A huge fraction of this country's goods move on trucks following a small number of routes.  In order to properly license and tax this trade, trucks are periodically diverted to weigh stations. Our terrorists take control of one of these, preferably near an old open-pit mine or some similar large disposal area.  They install a CB-radio jammer on the approach to the weigh station, and a cell-phone jammer in the station itself. They then divert trucks into the weigh station, flag them onto a side road, kill the truckers, and dispose of the trucks. While this would be a slow plot, you could probably go for days without being noticed, and if you abandoned your site before it was detected, you could set up and do the exact same thing again half way across the country.  In the course of a few days, you could destroy thousands of tons of shipping. The crucial thing to make this work would be the communications disruption -- you can operate this trick for as long as it takes word to get out.  You would need to disrupt most communications systems over a fairly large distance before your trap in order to make your trap harder to find.

For some years now there has been a number of highly vocal critics of the MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) immunisation jabs. By scaring parents with claims of children being damaged by MMR, there is now a substantial percentage of children who are not immunised and have no natural immunity to the three diseases.  As the diseases are still around, there are labs that culture all three in a number of locations.  Most of the available money will be spent on gaining access to live Measles, Mumps and Rubella cultures. The second stage is to get a number of older people placed in low wage inspection jobs within airports.  This may take a while, but I suspect that the turn over of personal inspecting shoes for hidden bombs will be high and there will be little difficulty in getting the people in place.  It's important to use older people as they will have had MMR jabs or will have gained natural immunity. Once in place the shoe inspectors infect the shoes of people during inspection.

These key people are told that unless they follow instructions, all family members will be killed. There is surveillance, so any contact with authorities will lead to instant death for their families. Fearing for their families, and seeing no way out, the key contacts do as they're told.  (Note, another variation is that the people are chosen, and instead of family members being kidnapped, some of them are offered several million $ in cash - some people are motivated by fear, some by greed. This would show that the terrorists have psychological profiles and a clear understanding of their subjects. Maybe some are even offered several million $ to their favorite charity or cause, further blurring the lines...) The instructions are slightly different, and done in a specific order. First, the water supplies are tainted; then malware is inserted into bank processing systems to begin siphoning money off to foreign accounts, and begin slowing down the ability to do transactions; then the airport traffic control systems are compromised, grinding air travel to a halt. Once the nuclear engineers have completed their instructions, the terrorists use the key contacts at the news agencies to play a tape warning that the water system is already tainted and people will begin dying within hours (people are already being rushed to emergency rooms), no one can leave b/c the airports are a confused mess and they can't get money anyway. The final warning is that the nuclear power plants will all detonate in 10 hours, and there's no way to stop it.

They become editors and one (or more because they are all operating independently) gets to work on one (or more...) major motion pictures.  They insert frames into the movie to subliminally suggest ""30 minutes after the end of the movie, kill the person next to you."" Now the crowds are lining up for the latest epic ""Male Star of the Day""/""Female Start of the Day"" blockbuster, opening in Theaters Nation Wide - with many having multiple screens showing the movie on the first day... - and 30 minutes after this mass murder on a national (global) scale ensues.  Of course, the particular breed of terrorists and their supporters won't be affected, because anyone of the right 'faith' wouldn't be caught dead in *THAT* movie anyway, so they all are existing happily.   (Note that this works for *ANY* organizatoin, and it doesn't matter if they are Religious Fanatics, Animal Lovers, Alien Sympathizers, or Trekkies looking for revenge on the 'Normal' people who have derided them for so long....)  But for the general population, the result is mass panic as everyone suddenly stops going out for fear of the person sitting next to them suddenly attacking them.  No more restaurants, movies, or crowded spaces...  Come to think of it, didn't your wife just look at you strangely while you were lying in bed???  The possibilities are endless.

c53810,a000808,"One great way to get past security is simply to face it head on... A terrorist group contacts a state that wishes to hurt the US and obtains an
old but operational cargo airplane.  There are many of these slowly rotting
away on quiet airstrips around the world as the second hand value is
currently low (even in the US there are vast airplane graveyards in a few
desert areas.)     The next step is to get a good reason for the plane to enter US airspace.
The easiest way is for it to do some legitimate work, for example shipping
charitable aid to famine areas such as the Sudan or Congo.  Once
established, it's possible to file a flight plan from those locations and
not raise any warning flags.     But the final flight out of the Sudan or Congo will not be empty. Instead
there is a cargo of high activity nuclear waste (from the Ukrane) and high
explosives.  After 9/11 the threat was assumed to be from a plane early in
its flight when it's still full of fuel, planes at the end of their flight
are assumed to be a much lower threat.     So, as our plane slowly descends over an east coast it may will be entirely
ignored until obviously targeting the city, with luck it won't even be
challenged.  But even if it is recognised as a threat and fighters manage to
intercept, the result will be widespread nuclear fallout over the city and
its surroundings.     (Can I expect a call from Homeland Security for writing this?)",Geoff Lane,2006-04-17 12:30:00

c53815,a000808,"In an America highly dependent on the Internet and fossil fuels for just about everything, the terrorists plan a three-prong attack executed during the next major hurricane crisis. 1) Coal mine operators desperate for workers unknowingly hire terrorists at ten different large mines throughout the U.S.  These terrorists plant timed bombs at various remote locations of the coal transport railways.  They then smuggle fire-inducing tools into the mines and ignite large amounts of coal creating a two-fold disaster that destroys a large coal supply while creating an environmental disaster that not only effects surrounding areas, but emits enough noxious fumes to create health problems for millions of Americans.  Rolling blackouts are forced all across the nation. 2) Terrorists plant bombs at hundreds of remote (cargo) railway locations throughout the U.S. and time them all to go off at the same time as the coal attack.  Further creating problems for power plants across the U.S.  Since numerous high-tension power lines also run parallel to these railways, bombs are also planted at these locations. 3) The third team of terrorists bombs ten of the most trafficked Internet hubs.  Taking out as much fiber optic cable as possible.  Since most of these central concentration points of Internet connectivity also host most of the Internet's most popular websites/servers, thousands of citizen's essential sites and servers disappear. The economic effects of this attack are devastating:  Due to the lack of coal supply, power plants are forced to institute rolling blackouts across the country.  As a result of this, people burn oil in generators at unsustainable rates, driving up the cost of oil to unheard-of prices.  Businesses that rely on Internet traffic/customers lose millions of dollars and many will go out of business. Then there's the escalating effects:  Due to lack of rail transport, companies are forced to use trucks which further increases demand for oil.  Firefighters from all over the country are diverted to contain the coal/forest fires started by the terrorist bombs leaving much of the country vulnerable to fire.  The extreme cost of oil weighs in rapidly on the consumer price index causing many to cut back on their purchases creating a major recession. Bankruptcies abound and the world starts to lose faith in America's long-term economic growth.  This results in foreign lenders pulling out of the U.S. Federal budgetary deficit market.  A catastrophic hyper-inflation is the result and the U.S. government starts printing money to pay for it's expanding deficit and the disaster-fighting problems caused by the terrorists. China announces that it is no longer going to use the U.S. currency as it's own currency base while at the same time pledging aid for the U.S. As a result of the suddenly near-zero exports to the U.S., China's own economy tanks, resulting in vast swaths of empty factories across the country as workers return home to provide food for themselves and their families the old fashioned way. Europe quickly finds that it has loads of wealth in the Euro and proceeds to become the next economic superpower of the world.  China shifts it's export focus to Russia, India, and Europe leaving the U.S. a broken wasteland where people are starving to death as a result of lack of imported food, major energy problems, and no end in sight to the civilian uprisings. The United States ends up splitting into Four separate regions: West Virginia up to Maine become a sovereign socialist nation.  They make an exclusive deal with Canada for the import of oil.  They use their remaining inter-continental Internet links to provide cheap information workers (call centers, outsourced work, etc) to Europe and India. Texas to Florida along with the central plains states form an authoritarian Christian theocracy that constantly borders on anarchy.  Warlords rise up and control working coal mines and large swaths of land.  Farmers are coerced into paying off these warlords and never really gain in economic status.  People attempt to cross the border into the northeastern states creating an illegal immigration problem.  Religious leaders become even more rich and powerful. Nevada to Washington forms a Libertarian/Federalist government where the primary focus is to export goods and services to china.  Trade deals are formed and much of the territory ends up being powered by Solar, Wind, and Nuclear energy.  Silicon Valley ends up burning down in a riot. Arizona separates out from the rest and forms a near-anarchy state with one well-regulated militia.  They import power through trade agreements with California. -Riskable

c53820,a000808,"The terrorists decide to disrupt American life by spreading disease in the US South and Midwest.  The mechanism is two fold: (1) destroy animal husbandry and (2) create reservoirs of disease that frighten the population and keep them indoors.  The result is the collapse of the rural economy in the South, and mass population migration as frightened people move to other areas of the country. Initial supplies of mosquitoes arrive as egg masses with an air traveler on a tourist visa.  Likewise, the viruses and bacteria breeding cultures arrive via tourists.  The material is in personal health care containers (toothpaste tubes, hair spray canisters, perfume bottles, etc.).  The terrorists enter through ports-of-entry known not to use x-rays or other radiation that might damage the bio-weapons. Once in the US, the terrorists spend 16 weeks growing the viruses, bacteria and viruses.  None of the agents are bio-engineered.  They are going to be introduced in their natural state, much like West Nile Virus entered the US a few years ago.  Thus, no complicated lab equipment is needed.  Just a small supply of rabbits and dogs to use in the life cycle of the disease and mosquito vectors. Finally, the time to spread the bioweapons has arrived.  The group breaks into too target sub-groups.  The smaller one (6 people in 2 operational teams of 3 each) takes the cultures of Brucella bacteria (that causes Brucellosis), foot and mouth virus, rind pest virus, and rabies.  The two teams spend the busy July and August months visiting county and state fairs in the South and Mid-West.  The animals (and people) infected here will spread around to other fairs, auction houses and various herds.  Because these diseases are unknown in the US, valuable time for spreading the diseases will result from the confusion.  Aiding the spread of the diseases will be the US Dept of Agriculture witch will not act aggressively, at first, because it doesn’t want a panic to hurt agricultural exports. The second, larger, group of 7 subgroups of three persons each will move around the South spreading Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with dengue & dengue hemorrhagic fever & yellow fever, TSETSE FLIES carrying sleeping sickness, and the Simulium damnosum mosquito with Onchocerciasis (River Blindness).  The groups will spread the infected mosquitoes in wetlands around large population centers like Huston TX, Miami FL, Tampa FL, Atlanta GA, Washington DC and the vacation areas of tidewater VA.

c53822,a000808,"Bridges. If I were a terrorist, this is what I would target.  Big, easy to find, and impossible to safeguard without making them nearly useless for their intended purpose of moving traffic at the highest volume possible.  A truck bomb is flashy, but a terrorist could plant a bomb underneath with a timer, or even take out the girders live with a blowtorch and a little patience. A single terrorist could just start taking out random bridges at random times, which would slowly but steadily ratchet up the public's fear.  A larger, well-funded group of terrorists could plan a coordinated attack that could spectacularly concentrate the effect.  Time to get creative. Plan 1: ""Isolate Long Island"":
   *  278 - Verrazano-Narrows Bridge
   *  478 - Brooklyn Battery Tunnel
   *  Brooklyn Bridge
   *  Manhattan Bridge
   *  Williamsburg Bridge
   *  Queens Midtown Tunnel
   *  Queensboro Bridge (both levels)
   *  278 - Triborough Bridge (near Astoria Park)
   *  678 - Bronx Whitestone Bridge
   *  295 - Throgs Neck Bridge
The tunnels would be harder to take out than the bridges, and would require more advanced preparation.  But this would completely isolate Long Island from the rest of the continent.            How about Plan 2:  ""Up the Hudson"":
   *  278 - Verrazano-Narrows Bridge
   *  Holland Tunnel
   *  495 - Lincoln Tunnel
   *  95 - NJ Turnpike / Cross Bronx Expressway Bridge
   *  287 - New York State Thruway Bridge
   *  6 - Bear Mountain Bridge

   *  55 - Mid-Hudson Bridge (Poughkeepsie)
   *  199 - Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge
   *  23 - Rip Van Winkle Bridge (Catskill)

c53824,a000808,"OK -- here's another way to cheaply create widespread terror and extreme economic disruption.  It's by making the normal and widespread to be terrifying. Week One: In 10 major cities, particularly in the Midwest, where it seems ""safe"", steal 2 UPS trucks and bump off the driver.  Leave exploding packages on doorsteps, with simple pipebombs and timers.  Result -- all UPS trucks stopped, and untrusted.  Any package left on any doorstop will cause a panic. Week Two: Affix pipebomb with cell-phone trigger to schoolbuses in several major cities.  Follow the schoolbuses and trigger explosions as the buses pull into school.  Result -- all US schools shut down in a panic, parents stay home from work to watch the kids, 30% of the economy at a stand-still. Week Three: Same tactic with pipebomb, affixing to tanker trucks at truck stops.  Follow them to a gas station, then detonate from a distance.  Result -- gasoline, diesel and kerosene distribution shutdown, people afraid to buy gas.  Two days later, affix to cars in suburbs, siphon their tank so they need to buy gas, then follow them to the gas station.  Now it's any car at the gas station! Week Four: Shift pipebomb strategy to random Honda Civics, Toyota Corollas, and Ford Probes.  You could easily plant 10 in a single evening, per city.  Follow into city, then detonate.  Shift to taxicabs two days later, then buses.  Transportation system shut down. Week Five: Shift pipebomb strategy to US Mail delivery vehicles -- every mailman looks like a terrorist. Week Six: Insert bombs into the orange barrels that line all construction zones on the highway, and detonate.  Select widespread targets, both urban and rural.  The highways shut down as a result.

The hippies are told they are to play the part of a prankster employed as Santa Claus at an inconic retailer or shopping mall, like Macy's in Manhattan or The Mall of America.

c53831,a000808,"Sometimes low tech is the way to go... Today it's a rare company that doesn't provide some kind of cooled water
dispenser.  We see them everywhere and never give a thought to what a
terrorist could do.   The large plastic bottles used in the water dispensers are carefully
designed to make it difficult to introduce anything into the water without
the seals being obviously broken. So we have to look for other attack
vectors.  There are two obvious possibilities.  Within the bottled water
plant, the returned bottles have to be cleaned and disinfected before reuse.
It may be possible to get people into jobs where they control and monitor
the quality of the cleaning process.  They could then introduce dysentery
into the bottles at a point where they are assumed to be clean.  The
refilled and infected bottles are then sent out to locations throughout the
city. The other possibility is the cooler maintainance staff.  The water
coolers are replaced regularly so they can be cleaned.  If the maintainance
staff were to place a source of dysentery within the cooler when it is
installed then it would be a long lasting source of infection.             It would be necessary to place operatives in most if not all the water
companies in an area to be really effective and produce a day zero attack
that would gain media attention.   Dysentery is an ideal disease as it is highly infectious and will rapidly
spread to those staff that do not drink the water from the cooler.
While there would not be a high percentage of deaths (there are a number of
simple, cheap treatments) a widespread infection in the population would
bring a city to a stop within days.  Because it targets the people rather
than computer systems, having secondary computer sites will be of little
help as the transfered staff will carry the dysentery with them (and even
better, the water in the other site will probably come from the same water
company...)         (In the good'ol'days everybody drank beer instead of water because dysentery
was killed during the brewing process.) ",Geoff Lane,2006-04-17 13:35:00

c53840,a000808,"My idea takes the shotgun approach.  Lots of smallish attacks all over. 30 men total.  3 man teams.  Should be a majority of ethnic caucasian men, but several black and  hispanic teams as well.  Everyone needs to speak excellent American English, and at least one other language, preferably Spanish. Arangements are made with Cuban/Venezuelan help, and/or Columbian drug trafficers, to bring over some millitary hardware into the US via the Mexican border: Two AKs for every man.  Folding stock models for greater concealment possibilities. 7.62x39mm, as it is too diffuclt to find 5.54x39mm in the US. 
  Two or three .45 pistols for every man, with a suppresser for each pistol, so they'll need to have threaded barrels. (.45 is subsonic, so no special ammunition will be needed.  The teams can resupply at any Walmart)
  One scoped and suppressed bolt action rifle per team
  Two or three cases of grenades for each team.
  A small amount of explosives and detonators for each team. No more than 300 pounds per team.
  Radio jamming equipment.  There should be some millitary grade, man-portable equipment that can jam cell phone signals, each team will need two. These may be available for purchase within the US, if so then they will be purchased there.  
  10 anti-air missles.  They should be heat seeking.       Each team buys several cars, minimum of three.  Good used ones, say Honda Accords or Toyota Camrys, in the South and West some pickups.  Cars will be in good working order, insurance and tags will be paid for.  All driving laws will be obeyed. They should go to driving school in Germany (or somewhere else where the rules are followed pretty strictly)  prior to heading to America. Teams will be given cash and multiple American Express cards.  Pay with cash whenever possible. AmEx cards are to be used in one city only, then destroyed. Ammunition will be purchased locally.  No sense in sneaking it across the border when it's avaialble for sale here.  Whenever possible, purchase items from Walmart.  :) Each team will immediately purchase several throw away cell phones.  Two or three per purchase, no sense raising any red flags. Get new ones at each city.  And get new ones after each attack.  Heasets for handsfree usage are to be used whenever possible. Goals of the teams is to create terror and chaos and panic.  The teams will drive around in their assigned areas, carrying out one attack per city/region, then moving on to the next city.  Attack and move on, attack and move on.  Do not drive and attack in a linear fashion, move about randomly.  Change appearance.  Beards or mustaches can be trimmed or removed.  Wear different clothes and hats.  Wear sunglasses whenever circumstances allow.  Change cars frequently. Each team will do as much of the following as possible: Arson in the southwest, setting forest fires, grass fires, especially around populated and dry areas, ie  California and  Arizona, Texas, and Colorado.  In addition, each team will create incendiary devices from locally produced materials and set fires in office buildings or houses, especialy houses in poorer areas. Whenever possible, caucasian teams should only kill minorities and shout ""Kill the Niggers!"" or other racial epitets.  This will cause additional confusion and panic, and perhaps spark more violence.  Black teams should target caucasians and shout ""Death to Honkies!"" Remember, the end goal is the destruction of America.  Racist materials should be left in cars and in hotel rooms, so that investegators will suspect the wrong people.  Spanish speaking and looking teams should shout slogans about La Raza and Azltan, and ""Death to Gringos!"" Those teams should communicate entirely in Spanish during the attacks. ""Sniping"" like the DC snipers. Modify one of their vehicles with a firing port through the trunk.  One man drives the car, another is in the trunk shooting.  The third man may be driving another car doing secuirty overwatch and/or spotting targets.  They will use the bolt action rifle for this.  This should be as random as possible in time of attack and in victim, however, whenever possible shoot young women, especially mothers with children.  More than one of these attacks are allowed per city, and can be done in conjuntion with the other attacks. Break in to houses during the day, perhaps disguised at delivery men or utility workers, and kill everyone inside that house.  Then leave.  Perhaps leave a small bomb behind set to go off at about 6pm, after the husband gets home and the police have arrived. Throwing of  bombs/grenades off of overpasses during rush hour.  Should be easy enough to toss a grenade out the window while driving over a congested highway.  This would involve multiple cars so that there is a car behind the  grenade throwing car to help block the view of it.  Ideally, the driver should not throw the grenade, a passenger should.  Both cars would have cell phone jammers and would activate them after the grenade is thrown. Pick one airport per team.  Find a spot near the flightline, in a residental neighborhood.  On the same day and at roughly the same time, kill the people living there and fire your one missle at an over flying plane from the backyard.  Wait till it has either just lifted off, or is about to land so that it's close and relatively easy to hit.  Escape. Small bombs, no larger than a pack of cards, planted in random products and placed back on the shelves.  This should be done at any large store, Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Best Buy, Fry's, Sears, Monkey Wards.  Bombs are timed to go off after a few hours.  Bombs could be placed in the produce section of a grocery store, at the bottom of a pile of apples or potatoes for example.  If possible, enter the employee only side of the grocery store and place a bomb in the milk. If confronted there, simply reply that you were looking for the ""freshest"" milk possible. Or kill the person, it's up to the team's discression. Small bombs can also be left in trash recepticles at malls, zoos, parks, shopping centers, gas stations, practically anywhere.  Disguise the bomb as trash and simply throw it out then drive away.  Small bombs could also be placed in mailboxes.  Bombs could also be placed in packages and sent from places like the UPS store, does not matter where it's sent to (although abortion clincs are probably a good idea for misdirection purposes), the idea is that it either explodes in the shipper's warehouse or on the truck. Bombs do not have to be big or deadly to scare the crap out of people. Likewise, small bombs can be attached to gasoline trucks at truck stops/gas stations.  Timed to go off anywhere from 15 minutes to several hours later. Mall shootings.  Each man in a team drives a car to the mall and parks on different sides.  They all have keys to each car.  (Probably best if the locks/ignition are changed to take the same keys.)  Cell phone jammer is in one of the cars and turned on.  Each man walks through killing everyone they can, exiting on the other side to get away in one of the other cars, or to fight it out with the police.  Grenades should be taken and tossed about into large crowds or into shops as they pass them.  Each man should have one timed bomb to set in a store or fountain or something, so that it explodes after they leave.  Each car that is used for this should have a timed explosive in the trunk to go off after, say, one hour.  If they escape, they either park the car somewhere where it will do damage, or defuse the bomb.  If they do not escape, it blows up, perhaps taking more people with it, at the very least sowing more panic and terror. Other gatherings of people to be attacked/destroyed in the same general format as the mall shootings:
  Community pool.  During summer break, especially on the hot days, community pools will be full of children frolicing about.   
  High school sporting events.   Large sporting events and political rallies are to be avoided: too much police/security.  Events with only one or two entrances/exits are to be prefered as it's easier to kill everyone inside them that way.  Basketball and volleyball games are good for shootings, football and baseball might not be, but you could plant bombs on the school busses.  
  Elementary schools or day care centers.  
  Bridal shows.  Full of young women about to get married, it would devestate the country's morale.  
  Churches/temples/synagogues. Attack during worship service on Sunday/Saturday morning, or perhaps at a funeral service during the week.  
  Bar or strip clubs.  For this, shout ""Death to Breeders!"" and have millitant homosexual literature to leave behind.  
  Boy or Girl Scout meetings.  Show up, kill everyone, then leave.  Talk about terror!
 Walmart, Super Target, or 24 hour grocery store. Attack at 3am, killing as many of the stockboys and customers as possible. Militant Vegan or PETA-type slogans and material could be shouted/left behind during these such attacks. Or anti-free trade materials.          Since it's a movie, the hero is a small border town sheriff, Bob, an ex-Navy SEAL enjoying his retirement by taking care of ""his"" town and keeping it safe from ""those damn Mexicans"".  The terrorists came in through his area and got into a firefight with some of his deputies, killing them all.  The Sheriff manages to capture one of the coyotes who led them in, a spunky young man named Pepe.   Since the terrorists killed all the other coyotes (narrowly missing Pepe) once they were in the US (the noise alerted the deputies), and the coyotes were his family, Pepe is glad to help out Bob and hunt down the evil terrorists.  There are stupid/ineffective/bureaucratic federal agents and local officials.     Car chases.  Gunfights.  Explosions.  Bob comes to appreciate the plight of the illegal immigrant.  Pepe is able to use his coyote contacts in the illegal immigrant comunity to track down the terrorists.  Love interest, perhaps between Bob and Pepe  (this is Hollywood after all).  More fighting.  Kung Fu.  One liners a la ""Let off some steam."" And more explosions.  Bob and Pepe figure out that the attacks, while seeming random, will spell out ""Allah Akbar!"" in Arabic if you look at the attacks plotted on a US/Mexico/Canadian map (the feds are just using US-only maps).  No one believes them, so they head on their own to the next attack where Bob is mortally wounded, and Pepe has to save the US.  But will he?  Will he?! ",gandalf23,2006-04-17 14:13:00
c53845,a000808,"Have you ever seen a cargo boat from China?  Tractor-trailer-sized containers stacked up on deck like Lego blocks.  Totally innocuous looking, and probably hundreds of them come in per day to the west coast.  What does China have too much of?  People.  So suppose they fill up 100 cargo ships with people, armed only with guns and knives and a month's supply of food to get across the ocean.  They land simultaneously and disgorge an invading horde 100 times the size of the D-Day invasion of Normandy.  The soldiers disperse quickly into heavily populated port cities like Los Angeles, Oakland/San Francisco, San Diego, Seattle etc.  Now, air power over American cities is useless against this diffuse enemy amongst us, and local police forces are helpless against the overwhelming tide.  The Chinese roam the streets, killing everyone in sight, and within hours they have taken over the entire west coast of the U.S.  Perhaps an equivalent scenario on the eastern coastal cities, and in one day 40% of the U.S. population is under Chinese military control.  And that's without weapons bigger than rifles!  Imagine if they disguised 10 aircraft carriers as cargo ships also, or had nuke-launching capability on them, etc. to take out the defending nearby military bases. Or for economic war, billions of dollars in damage could be done to the economy with only a few dozen major explosions.  Take out the Intel chip factories in Oregon, Microsoft headquarters in Seattle, the major Internet hubs, AT&T network operations center, GM factories, Coca-Cola syrup plant, cigarette and beer factories, Boeing plant, Citibank data center - look up the Dow Industrials and bomb their most expensive factories.  Post 9/11 they may actually have some security now, but probably not enough to stand up to a few dozen real enemy soldiers staging a takeover, or for that matter a rocket hobbyist building his own artillery and launching from a pickup truck a mile away.  Multiple targets would have to be attacked simultaneously, because after the first wave security would increase sharply.",Port wine authority,2006-04-17 14:32:00
c53846,a000808,"I'm surprised that terrorists haven't blown up trains by destroying the tracks. Why run the gauntlet of security guards at the railway station to smuggle a bomb on board when you can achieve exactly the same result by driving out into the countryside and planting a bomb under the tracks? This is a classic example of asymmetrical warfare. You certainly wouldn't need anywhere near the level of financing and resources that Bruce Schneier suggests as a starting point for a terror-campaign. Consider:- the US railway network is many thousands of miles long, and it's impossible to police every yard of it. Terrorists could so easily plant explosives under the track, then wait until a train was directly overhead before detonating the charge, thereby derailing the train and everything/everyone on it. If the train happened to be carrying hazardous materials (eg liquified propane gas that could be ignited with a few rounds of incendiary ammo) then the level of disruption/damage would be far greater. This mode of attack could be coupled with announcing ""open season"" on anyone working for the railway or using them to transport goods. A few high-profile shootings of blue-collar railway workers (plus their families) would be very persuasive.",Androctonus,2006-04-17 14:35:00
c53847,a000808,"OK, so a team of five to seven unskilled and one or two trained terrorists infiltrate one of the ""Party Boat"" cruise ships that go on three-day cruises from Long Beach, California, to Ensenada Mexico. As the crews of these ships are often foreign ""hospitality workers"" who sign on for a season or two, it would be easy enough to do. These terrorists work in the galley. On the way back from Ensenada, they contaminate the food throughout the various dining facilities with botulinium or tularensis bacteria, causing a serious outbreak onboard the vessel. Either of these bacteria could cause severe illness, and suffient morbidity to cause panic onboard the vessel. The outbreak has been timed to coincide with the vessel's return to port. Ship-to-shore communication will guarantee some media coverage of the outbreak, but, as yet, it is not revealed to be anything more than a freak outbreak of disease. Debate will emerge whether or not to quarantine the ship, or whether the mystery ailment onboard is contagious. Communication from the passengers to loved-ones on shore will further generate attention; since it's a ""party boat,"" plenty of video of the terrible conditions will be available for rebroadcast on television. The ship will be moored outside of Long Beach harbor while public health officials take action. They fly a biohazard team out to the ship on a helicopter to investigate. The terrorists, who have broken into two tactical teams, take advantage of the general chaos at this point: the first team takes over the ship's bridge, while the second team commandeers the helicopter. The team at the bridge opens up the ship to full throttle, and proceeds to ram any available oil tankers that are moored at the Long Beach facilities. If they are able, they engage in multiple ramming operations -- regardless, they will succeed in at least one ramming, thereby releasing hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil into the harbor. This not only disrupts an extremely busy shipping port, causing financial damage that spreads across the entire economy, but also an environmental disaster. Since this is a movie plot and not reality, we might as well make the oil slick burst into flames, so there are big orange fireballs and lots of thick black smoke. Meanwhile, terrorist crew number two has taken the helicopter and flown inland a short way to one of the many oil refineries. They either cleverly land near one of the gasoline storage stages and set it afire, or crash their helicopter into it. Either way, the explosion is phenominal, and disables much of the refinery. It also draws away much needed emergency support for the drama unfolding at the harbor, while causing extreme suspicion of all currently airborne helicopters. Naturally, since this is a movie, the suspicion results in at least one mistaken shoot-down; doubtless of a much-loved radio traffic reporter who we were introduced to in an earlier scene (his ex-wife is probably on the ship, and we probably saw her deciding during the cruise that her new boyfriend is a loser  and she's going to return to the husband). So now the port is shut down for at least a few days, and gasoline supplies are disrupted in the Southern California area. Thousands of tourists are dead of disease and/or trauma, and the Holiday Cruising Industry is pretty much destroyed for a season, if not longer. The economy is damaged, confidence is shaken, and, to cap it all, the one terrorist who allowed himself to be taken alive gloats on television that the entire plot cost the terrorists less than $10,000, while causing billions of dollars worth of damage. He also smirks, before being dragged off, that it's just the first salvo in a planned barrage across several vulnerable industries. This plot has it all -- bio-warfare; large numbers of innocent civilians caught up and suffering on television; dramatic explosions; and serious economic impacts. It evolves in stages, each of which attracting more attention so more media outlets can cover it live. And, if you're willing to neglect reality, it's plausible.",S,2006-04-17 14:39:00

c53859,a000808,"Movie title : ""14 days"" Take your 30 terrorists and divide them into 10 groups of three. You then give each a schedule of a small number of geographically close cities, say Austin-Fort Worth-San Antonio, or Chattanooga-Nashville-St Louis. Each group rents an apartment in each city under the name of one of the individuals in the group. For instance, from Bob, Sam, and Andy's group, Bob rents the place in Austin, Sam rents the place in Ft Worth, and Andy rents the place in San Antonio. Each apartment has a small stash of explosives, or a nearby storage facility or other kind of stash so nobody has to transport anything city to city. Each team starts out in the first city, and on a predetermined day, hits a random, easy target in that city. A small bomb at a gas station. Blow up a small storefront. Punch holes in gas tanks in a large parking lot and toss a road flare in after a few minutes. Open up the valves on the gas stove at the apartment and set a simple electric spark timer. Park a van full of explosives somewhere. Open a few dozen propane tanks in a parking lot. Nothing hard, nothing that you couldn't get away from easily. Right after the attack, go to the next city and repeat. And again. Stagger the operations so that on any given day over a two week period, there is at least one attack, with the concentration of attacks at the end, to account for teams getting captured or killed. Make the last attack something spectacular and suicidal. This would have an especially chilling effect as the staggared final attacks come in. Everyone sees that first really big one (e.g., 3 trucks full of explosives next to supporting pylons of a busy overpass in 5:00 traffic. Just pull over and *boom*) as the last one.  ""That sure was a big one...that must have been the last attack...phew, it's over."" Then another big one. And another, and another.

c53860,a000808,"Bin Laden has already set in motion the mother of all movie plot threats. He's now eating popcorn and watching it! The one common thread following the terrorist attacks in New York, Madrid and London (and to a lesser extent bombings in other countries) has been the loss of civil liberties and protections from government through hastily enacted ""anti-terrorism"" laws (the misnamed Patriot Act and its various copycats).
It is a tenet of Western democratic thinking that a democracy's strength is derived from citizens' liberties and freedoms which foster, among other things, open and free communication, cooperation and pursuit of individual sucess, leading to the overall success of democratic society. As such, the anti-terrorism laws recently enacted are detrimental to democracy, weaken the nations that enact them and hence work to the benefit of the terrorist organizations that seek to overthrow Western deomcracies.  With this idea, the overall terrorist strategy is to execute relatively few high profile bombings and then sit back with a bucket of popcorn and watch as democratic countries implode, or at least weaken considerably, through their own irrational fear and knee jerk reaction to a vastly over estimated threat.

c53882,a000808,"Ok lets assume 30 people, and given 500 grand straight. The first and formost thing to think about is very simply randomness. The more random and farsweeping the more it will terroize the public. Therefore like the 9/11 hijackers, several cells deployed at strategic places in the contenental US. THeir targets: Everything and anything. Unlike 9/11 there is very little central planning, each cell is given a basic amount of cash, training in armed weapons, suggestions of targets, a set date, and designations within the group. Of the thirty people ten will be directly tied together, they are the planners and the leaders. Each group decides on a city, some large, some small. Each group is given their funds and are bid farewell.A date and time is set for the action. No group talks to any other part of the group before, durring, or afterwards they only talk to the director or a proxy. Consider 1: The Targets
We often here stories about terrorists poisoning water wells and trying to topple landmarks, but by far the most scary terror plots take place where we live and work.The most terrifying assasination happens when it is not just an innocent, but when it is someone who protects the innocent. Thirdly, abruptness is key. The quicker and more flashy the act, the more it grabs headlines. FInally, safe and clean targets, aka, the local police station, walmart, grocery stores,tim hortons, make people scared to go to these places.
For instance:
Before the commital of the act the Terrorist would undoubtably scout the location. Being the smart, almost normal person he is, the scouting would be so light as to not draw attention. He merely drives once or twice near the target building, getting the bearings for the attack. Sightlines, parking spots, even traffic all play a part. This particular terrorist choses the police station of a small nevada town, not large enough to be a flurry of activity, but small enough to be thouroughly busy at rushour. He is acting as part of a small group, only three people know him, this small group has been able to construct a crude RPG launcher using household supplies and training from the previous months. A week from the scouting on the date set forth beforehand, a day thad had no meaning, they assemble in a parking garage across from the station and wait for the correct hour.
The improvised weapon is launched and strikes the building creating caos, the terrorists then flee back to where they came.     Consider 2: The Weapons
Creativeness is encouraged. Anyone can create a bomb, but a tub of clorine dropped from a ahigh building onto a busy street is just as effective. The more outlandish the weapon, the scarrier the result. Remember the shoe bomber? Now because of him people take their shoes off at every security point. Imagine the caos from the underwear bomber. It sounds ubsurd, but when people start proposing a jaunt through your jockeys every time you go through the security line people stop laughing.  Consider 3: Irony
The more Ironic, the more it hurts. It may be crude, but a rented gas guzzling suv filled with a nice large fertilizer bomb ramming through the unlocked gates of an unsuspecting airport bound for a plane loaded with passengers is sure to attract alot of attention. Another possiblility is kidnapping an oil exec and drowning him in his own crude. Both of these acts send a stong message, and will sit in others minds because of the lasting Irony.

Unless Earth's population is reduced to - and kept to - under 500,000 people by 2012, the aliens will use genetically-engineered prions to wipe everyone out. Why? Because it's their planet, not ours. They created us accidentally by tweaking early primates, and now return to their terraformed paradise planet, Earth, to find it overrun and being ruined by billions of selfish primitive humans. Not only that, but we are on the verge of interstellar travel and immortality drugs. We are utterly warlike by their standards and no way will humans be allowed to develop technologies which threaten the Galaxy (shades of Iran).

Back when SAR's broke out briefly I couldn't understand why all this fuss about biological labs when all a terrorist organisation needed was to buy a few plane tickets and recruit a small group of ""suicide coughers"". It would be relatively simple to have a group standing by in some remote location (possibly Africa) waiting for the next report of Ebola, Marburg or SAR's. They then fan out over the breakout area with the goal of at least one of them getting inoculated, meeting back in 36 hours. At which point they all mutually inoculate from whoever is ""live"" and the fresh cases fan out with the goal of transiting international flights and hubs continuously until they drop dead or are diagnosed. At each hub they discretely smear bodily fluids on door handles. With some rudimentary network design the number of infected people would spiral rapidly beyond retrieval.

Not many people would die in any one explosion, but the terror inflicted would be high - for one, people would have a fear of using the things...imagine being enclosed in a dark space in a compromising position when terror strikes! Also, the very existence of the toilets could be considered a security threat, and large public gatherings would no longer be permitted to have these large numbers of hiding places. Imagine a festival with 100,000 people and 5 toilets, each manned by a security guard?

c53897,a000808,"Here is my movie plot (I’ll call it “Tucson By Morning��?): 1.	A sleeper cell that has been in the U.S. for years sets up a warehouse business in Tucson, AZ near the Pima Air Museum/AMARC (Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center) and Davis-Monthan Air Force Base where thousands of old aircraft are stored.  They use the $500K to start a warehouse business that buys and sells overstocked merchandise so that large numbers of trucks and trucks carrying unusually shaped items come and go on a regular basis.  They pass themselves off as Americans with Mexican names and speak fluent Mexican. 2.	Some time later, twelve terrorists come into Tucson, AZ via Mexico as Mexican nationals.  Six obtain pilot licenses while working at the warehouse.  Six take courses in aircraft maintenance while also working at the warehouse. 3.	For several years they take detailed photos of the old planes at AMARC and Davis-Monthan.  At night they go through the fence to examine planes up close to determine which planes can be repaired and flown or which ones can be cannibalized. 4.	Overstock business and eBay allows them to obtain the equipment necessary to modify and repair old aircraft over time. 5.	In the warehouse they build replicas of old fighter aircraft and modify trucks to carry them and the real planes. 6.	The pilots rent planes on a regular basis and fly the route north and northwest so they get to know the route to Glen Canyon Dam and the Hoover Dam at low altitudes. 7.	Late at night and one by one over a short period they take the replica of an old fighter into a deserted part of the area that holds old planes and unload the replica and load in the actual plane using a crane system (I know – a stretch of the imagination is needed here).  The replica is positioned where the old plane was.  People will of course assume that this is the real plane. 8.	The old fighters are repaired and prepared for flight. 9.	On the night for the attack they hijack fuel trucks that would be going to Davis-Monthan and use them to fuel the planes. 10.	The planes then taxi over to I-10 on Valencia Road and head east on I-10 which is straight and flat for many miles with no overpasses. 11.	They take off and turn and head north and northwest. 12.	Three planes head for Glen Canyon Dam and three head for Hoover Dam.  They go supersonic and hit the dams.  The intent is to cause failure in both dams, flood the areas, deprive the southwest of drinking water and deprive Las Vegas and California cities of electricity.  Other dams on the Colorado are also destroyed by the failure of the Glen Canyon and Hoover Dams. This plot has several interesting aspects: 1.	It uses our own weapons against us.  Our fighters. 2.	It uses one of the gems of America, namely, the Eisenhower Interstate System against us.  Ironic that the latter was built to do precisely this – in the event of an invasion, the straight parts of the interstates were meant to be used as makeshift airfields and runways as well as move men and material quickly. 3.	It causes instant, unstoppable and long term damage especially to Las Vegas and Los Angeles. 4.	Having a business that buys and sells overstock is an easy business to be in and can be made self-sustaining so that the $500K is augmented. 5.	When people see USAF planes on the interstate they assume they meant to land at Davis-Monthan and think the pilots missed runway.  Therefore there is no concern that USAF planes are on I-10. 6.	I know that an imagination is needed to pull off some of this but I think that is OK for now.",TimC,2006-04-17 21:32:00

There they find the ""crackers"" where they blast them full of holes, effectively putting the refinery out of action for a month at least, depending on how big the resulting fire is. Putting three or four sufficiently large refinieries out of action for an extended period of time would 1) affect the price of gas, 2) put a lot of people out of work, 3) make people feel insecure. Scenario 2. A large team of terrorists break into small teams heavilly armed with oxy acetylene torches and start cutting their way through as many power pylons as they can find, just enough so that next time the wind blows they start to fall over. Do enough of them in enough places will result in serious power outages for extended periods of time.

A large group of terrorists raid any number of power plants (nuclear would be best but as long as it has a turbine its ok), and wreck the turbines (at speed it doesn't take a lot), again large power outages. Do enough of them and total blackouts then rolling blackouts for months.  Scenario 4

It was fairly high concept, and likely unfilmable, not only due to the current political climate, but also that there would likely be no one willing to allow a location for shooting. The plot description: Terrorists seize a theme park from inside out.  The terrorists systematically put themselves in as employees at the park.  They use the actual employees as chemical weapons by installing temperature controlled detonation devices inside of costumes that they force a portion of the kidnapped employees to wear.  If they remove the costume, they trigger the bomb.  Costumed employees are escorted by terrorists to strategic locations in the park. Also central to the story is that the park is hosting a ""movie props"" display from an ""upcoming"" action movie, one of which is appears to be a ""replica"" of a large explosive device, which is actually a large chemical weapon Midway through the day, when attendance is at it's peak, the terrorists make their prescence know and seal off all entrances to the park.  The park itself is made to resemble Walt Disney World in design in that there are no conventional ""walk up"" methods of entry into the park from the front. Demands are made of the terrorists, but the demands are made in vain.  Their intentions are to detonate two chemical weapons that day.  They intend to kill everyone in the park with a nerve agent, and then have a second weapon detonate afterward releasing massive quantities of anthrax into the air, infecting the park and the surrounding area.  They make their ""release"" demands without telling their true intentions. The end result of the movie is that the terrorists do manage to detonate the nerve agent, killing the majority of the patrons in the park, but are not able to detonate the second bomb.  The hero of the movie manages to apprehend the mastermind of the plot, and keep him alive, against the terrorist's will.

London had just been announced as the host to the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, but most thought it unlikely that the bombings had anything to do with it, since it had just been announced the day before. This got me thinking about how fast a small, loosely orginized group of people could put together a similar strike. I imagine the group deciding to blow the city up at 4:00pm, and getting together by 5:00pm. They get the city bus route and choose a list of routes that will be roughly evenly distributed throughout the city at around 7:30am the next day. They get the explosive materials for the bombs and practice making a few of them. They're simple pipe bombs using synchronized wristwatchs for timers and packed gunpowder for an explosive. One end of the pipe is just stuffed with clay, and this end is packed with matchstick heads. The explosion will be directed out this end and the flaming matchsticks are intended to fly out and detonate the gas tank on the bus (this is unlikely to actually work, but when was the last time Hollywood acknowledged that fact?). By midnight, they've got a design down that they can all put together in less than 10 minutes per bomb. At 4:00am, each member drives near their assigned bus routes and walks the last few blocks to the bus stop. They each take a swig of vodka before getting on and impersonate a student who had been out drinking all night and needs a quick bus ride home. With the bus relatively empty at this time, they choose a seat over the gas tank and leave a backpack there. They get off at stops where another member has already left their car, which has more backpacks and bomb-making materials in the trunk. With few passengers on board, they can build each bomb right on the bus. At 7:30am, buses throughout the city are detonating.

(One of the 9/11 planes flew by this site.) The spent fuel pools are not in a hardened building like the reactor.  If the crash was able to cause the water to be drained from the pools, the ensuing fire and etc. would be extremely hard to put out would spew highly contaminated radioactive stuff into the atmosphere. Given the typical westerly winds, the fallout would likely contaminate the a key focul point of NYC water supply and cut off most of the overland routes into NYC (except the GW, Holland, and Veranzano).

c54033,a000808,"Bruce Schneier's ""movie-plot"" terrorist threat contest entry. Cripple the effectiveness of U.S. law enforcement and other first responders while slowing the retail economy to a standstill.  Society begins to crumble with the reduction in their effectiveness and loss of confidence in their ability to keep order and safety.  The economy tanks as people fear to shop in retail stores and online...  It begins with Bruce's suggested resources... 30 terrorists with a 500,000 bankroll purchase a variety of costumes and some simple explosives. and unfolds like a chess game, one gambit at a time, each forcing the next move. 12 Terrorists purchase items from retail stores pack them with explosives and surreptitiously return them to store shelves.  Computers, CD players, boom boxes, TV's, cat food, etc.  Some will be caught when ""smuggling"" explosive items back into ""Best Buy"" and ""Wal-mart"".  The deaths of a few dozen shoppers throughout the country or a period of days combined with the publicity of the apprehended terrorists causes retail shopping revenue's to fall drastically. Commerce moves to online sites where these terrorists have purchased and returned fully functional equipment, now laded with explosives.  A few more deaths from on-line purchases and several devices discovered before they could be ""re-shelved"" causes on-line sales to plummet.  A score of exploding devices bought on ebay adds to the confusion and decline of on-line sales.  These terrorists continue their methods over the course of days and weeks (and perhaps months until they are identified and apprehended.)  Information planted on the terrorists lead authorities to believe that there are 50 such agents.  Thus they will continue to broadcast the threat even after the last of this group are restrained. Summoning bomb squads becomes routine for retail outlets with both real and imagined threats- similar to the anthrax scares following the real anthrax attacks. Phase II.
4 terrorists acting singly plant suspicious packages in retail stores, notify the management and leave to don their pre-purchased bomb-squad costumes.  ""Arriving"" at the store before the real bomb-squad only to pull firearms from their black bags and shoot everyone in sight.  After a few of these events the stores and public become wary of ""bomb squads"".  Police departments waste valuable time trying to identify ""real bomb-squad members"" from the fakes at every call.  The original terrorists continue to plant real and fake bombs. A few copy cat bombers emerge in the mayhem.  There is a ""friendly fire"" event where a jittery Sheriff's deputy shoots and kills a state bomb squad member.  Bomb squads approach police officers with even more trepidation and vise-versa. Phase II
The remaining terrorists don their ""police officer"" costumes in groups of 4, and find lone police officers to kill them and take their patrol vehicles.  Any of the killing attempts that fail will generate additional publicity and fear of the new fake police officers.  Terrorists will then use the police vehicles to randomly pull over vehicles on the highways.  When the vehicles are stopped the terrorist ""police"" will shoot and kill the vehicle occupants.  They will enter retail outlets as well killing customers and quickly leaving in the patrol cars.  Word will continue to spread about ""fake"" police officers as the terrorists continue, and are slowly caught and killed.  An additional friendly fire incident will happen between two groups of real police officers.  Multiple officers will be killed.  The confidence and compliance of the public in and with the police forces will be greatly reduced.  Much time an energy will be spent in trying to verify the identity of police officers among themselves and to the public.  Law Enforcement will be forced to patrol in teams of two vehicles both for protection but mostly as a way of quick certification to the public that they are legitimate law enforcement personnel.  (There being no accounts of the terrorist attacking from multiple police vehicles simultaneously in once attack).At this point law enforcement effectiveness will be cut in half, due to the dual patrols and likely in half again as each law enforcement encounter with the public and other law enforcement agents proceeds very slowly and cautiously.  General law and order begins to degrade nationwide. Phase III
At this point the few remaining members of the terrorist team will divert ambulances and rescue squads; and kill the occupants.  Dressed in medical outfits they will monitor the radios and attempt to reach calls for medical assistance before police or other medical units.  In the small percentage of events where the terrorists are the first on the scene they will disembark and shoot (at) everyone in sight before quickly re-entering their vehicles.   Once again another public service is doubted. If they are not first to arrive on a scene they will await another opportunity.  In this environment everyone becomes suspicious of first responders.  Ignoring police vehicle strobe lights to pull over on highways becomes common.  The police suspect the medical technicians and vice versa.  The public fears calling for help from the police or rescue squad.  Crime increases at a tremendous rate as ""common criminals"" realizes that effectiveness of law enforcement has been greatly reduced.  The economy begins a quick slide as employees are afraid to work at their retail positions due to bombs; customers are afraid to visit the stores or order equipment online.  Unskilled workers are laid off work and crime from the unemployed skyrockets.  The fear is perpetuated long after all the terrorists are caught and killed due to the occasional ""friendly fire"" event, the rare copy-cat bomber/shooter and the implication that there are many more terrorists yet uncaught. Riots begin to protest law enforcement's ineffectiveness and crimes perpetrated in their names.  Protests demand the government do something ""Now"".  Riots spread to dozens of cities.  Societal conduct crumbles and lawlessness abounds as law enforcement pales in the face of the tasks it is asked to perform.  The President declares a national state of emergency.  National Guard are called out nationwide, placing a further burden on the nations economy as productive workers are pulled from their jobs. The President, using his emergency powers declares that every man, woman and child will be required to carry RFID identification, readable at 100 yards, with them at all times, giving their occupation, description, and home address to any querying device.  Privacy and Religious activists stage civil disobedience ""strikes"" across the country leading to further fragmentation and unrest.  RFID cards and readers are quickly reverse engineered and spoofed by researcher sponsored by the same privacy advocates and religious right, hamstringing this lame effort to restore confidence in public workers. The economy, law enforcement, and medical services near complete collapse over the course of a few months while trust in public officials and public employee's  has eroded away to non-existance.

In the midst of a huge media circus, an American executes a daring suicide bombing run to kill Osama and succeeds (a bombing run that cannot be explained by anyone who knew the bomber – he was actually an American born and American raised suicide bomber).  Meanwhile, a new snake is rising to take control (let’s call this new leader Ajaf).  Using the death of Osama to inspire a new generation of terrorists, Ajaf creates a new network of terrorist cells within the U.S. using small 2 to 3 man teams.  Each team purchases common household supplies from dozens of stores and begin creating bombs that they can strap to themselves.  Ajaf positions each cell to be responsible for a single target within an appointed window of time.  Additional secondary and tertiary targets are also identified for each team just in case they need to alter their plans.  These targets are intended to be large gatherings of people - mostly women and children.  The first attack goes off in the heart of Disneyland just days before Thanksgiving.  A few days later another attack takes place.  And another, and another, and another over a period of days.  All major targets focused on dense family populations.  The US Government is spiraling out of control - they cannot track these terrorists down, nor can they predict their next target.  The American people are gripped by fear and unable to leave their homes – again and again new attacks are reported and the Government has no answers.  People become angry and intolerant of the U.S. Government and of anyone they tie to the threat of terrorism.

In the dead of night, a soldier outside an undisclosed secret military facility has his neck broken by an invisible evil.  A little girl is awakened to the sound of tanks outside her window.  It is the present day. A nefarious band of terrorists has itself mailed first class to the United States.  Utilizing inexpensive hardware and simple incendiary devices, they've managed to destroy many of the internet's major nodes and other vital communications hubs, simultaneously crippling the air and rail systems and disrupting satellite feeds.  CENTCOM is alert level Zed as clandestine military operations in the middle east have been compromised internally.  Several agents experience gruesome, rapid-fire deaths. Hotel room, daytime.  A group of stereotypical militant jihadists are inspecting what appears to be a trained bird of prey; a falcon, or perhaps a bald eagle.  We soon learn that the bird is really a convincing remote controlled airplane.  It flaps its wings as one of the mustachioed men laughs maniacally.  Cigar smoke fills the room.  Through the haze, we close in on a shot of the cigar's label.  Made in Cuba. The president is a bumbling yokel with less of a clue than a bulemic cheerleader at fat camp.  His approval rating has sunk to an unprecedented depth following an unpopular invasion of an especially unintimidating country.  Concealed by his curtain of embattled ignorance, a coup is in the works.  The secretary of defense is fearful that he may lose his job.  Mounting discontent from military leaders and politicians down both sides of the aisle has the defense secretary walking on eggshells.  Or so it would seem. The little girl, it turns out, is the daughter of a top NSA agent.  She is gifted with psychic abilities following her father's accidental exposure to a supersecret military gas intended as a kind of non-temporary suntan lotion.  Unknown to government researchers, the gas also effortlessly removes bubblegum from sidewalks.  The NSA agent begins to unravel the defense secretary's plans, and at the crucial moment when all is to be revealed to him, his office door swings open and his daughter runs in, screaming. ""Father!  It's not too late!  You don't want to know the horrible secret!  They'll kill you if you discover it!"" The envelope is seen descending in slow motion, further, more slowly still, until it is seen landing, ever-so-softly and with some Vaseline on the lens, smack dab in the middle of an extra-fancy NSA trashcan. Meanwhile, the Chinese have begun a secret invasion of their own, with all the people of China - men, women, and children - paddling their way over to America in small, unassuming boats. The plan, as it turns out, is to fly the fake eagle at the president.  The bird may be strapped with some kind of explosive, or else it may emit a poison gas from its nose.  Either way, the secret service guys will not shoot at it, fearing that it may be on some endangered species list somewhere.  It's only a matter of time before the president's big speech at Tom Cruise's placenta banquet, and you'd better believe the Scientologists are in on it.  The clock is ticking. A Mujahideen splinter group has spiked the water supplies of all major U.S. cities with hallucinogens.  The Internet is still mostly unavailable, which has created a sort of YouTube- and MySpace-deprivation psychosis pandemic.  Martial law has been imposed and only crazy people with guns are allowed outside after dark.

They high-jack two ambulances; and drive one to the first intersection; it sits on the track with sirens and lights going - the train stops to avoid hitting it. The two intersections are selected so that the chlorine tank car is now stopped at the second one.  The second ambulance, driven by a suicide bomber, arrives at the stationary tank car and crashes into it, causing the chlorine to spill, spreading 90 tons of poisonous gas throughout the surrounding area.

c54223,a000808,"Gas Bar Cancer Terror Who owns America's gasoline infrastructure?  The important part of it is right in the public domain - gas stations.  In many cases, they are owned by individuals as independent or franchised stations. Deep-cover terrorists - enemies on American soil here for years or decades - purchase and operate gas stations across the country, specifically in the more populous metropolitan areas.  Additionally, more terrorists will get jobs as truckers hauling fuel tankers, having access to both their fuel load, the destination tanks, and refinery distribution centers.  At the same time, they start stockpiling quantities of low-level radioactive material, possibly from decomissioned X-ray machines, scrapped smoke detectors, or other sources. On a pre-designated date, these materials are atomized by grinding or electrical discharge machining and introduced into the fuel tanks of these gas stations, possibly including diesel stations as well.  As a result, highly aerosolized radioactive material is dispersed throughout urban centers, for a period of weeks or even months.  This will expose tens of millions of Americans to these cancer-causing agents. Within a year or less, cancer rates in these metropolitan areas will start skyrocketing.  No one will suspect why, or even how, until vehicle engines start prematurely failing, and registering a high degree of radiation.  By then it will be too late - over half of the US population, regardless of age, background, religion, or political beliefs, will have been exposed, necessitating the immediate confiscation of all fuel available to the public in every gas station, and decontaminated if possible.  Transportation will grind to a halt for weeks until clean fuel can be distributed.  Concurrently, the entire population of the US will need to be treated for radiation exposure, for which there will not be nearly enough for even a tenth of the population.  Rioting will be prevalent. This will have long-lasting effects on the entire country, including high infant mortality, stillbirth, and miscarriage rates.  Cremation of the deceased may not be permitted, depending on how contaminated each person becomes with radioactive material. The terrorists involved will not be immune to their plans - they will get sick and die to.  They will be on a suicide mission, and will very likely succeed.",Mr Ska,2006-04-19 21:24:00
c54225,a000808,"The terrorists resurrect the bubonic plague in its pneumonic plague form - it can be transmitted from person to person through respiratory droplets. The mortality rate for untreated cases in real life is supposedly over 90%. Though the plague can currently be treated with modern antibiotics, this strain has been evolved by the terrorists in the lab to resist treatment (in the same way that many modern viruses have naturally evolved to resist antibiotics). The terrorists release large numbers of infected fleas on airplanes and in major airports, and perhaps in places like the Pentagon and the White House. Any place with large crowds, such as major sports events or concerts, are targeted.   Eventually millions of people will be infected with the bubonic plague without any chance of treatment - most of them will die within a week of their infection. (The terrorists could have infected themselves with a treatable strain, thus becoming immune to being infected again?) The outbreak of the bubonic plague would not only cause millions of deaths but also create a mass hysteria. Pretty much everyone has learned about the Black Death of the 14th century and seen the images of dead bodies piled up in carts and fields. The mass media, by its mere nature of reporting events, would make it known to everyone that the basic second 'black death' had come to America. People everywhere would be  freaking out -- the phrase 'bubonic plague' has tragic and well--known connotations/history that other diseases (SARS, anthrax, etc do not have). Americans would be terrified. With this kind of mass hysteria, the terrorists would basically be able to do anything. Blowing up a school would provoke a much greater reaction than it would otherwise. It would be easy for the terrorists to induce chaos and confusion in the masses. As we all know, the Black Death in the 14th century had HUGE imacts on the economy & society of Europe. It would likely also change the course of America's history - probably not to the same extent, but it would definitely cause many lasting damages. This probably sounds more like a disaster or killer virus movie, but that's what'll make it more effective. The movie could have a main plot about the effects of the black plague, juxtaposed with flashback scenes of the terrorists planning and releasing the plague. The concept of a biological weapon (disease) that is released by just 30 people but ultimately kills millions is incredibly terrifying (to me, anyway). The focus of the movie could be about the horror of the second black death, as well as the inner conflicts that the terrorists face when planning and carrying out this act. The possible inner conflicts could be yet another kind of horror.. even though the terrorists know so many people will be killed and may even feel guilt or doubt about it, they still ultimately go through with it.",Haven,2006-04-19 21:41:00

In addition to the explosives there's stuff in there that will burn when exposed to air.  When the timers run down (some weeks from when they start) they burst the tanker and the fuel spills out and ignites.  $500k will buy a *LOT* of bombs, that's a *LOT* of big fires. 4)  Gas stations.

As goofy as it sounds, there are 47 Starbucks coffeehouses within two miles of the White House, and more than a dozen within three blocks. (You can check my math at Starbucks.com by using the 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC address in the store locator applet.) I'm pretty sure Starbucks doesn't do background checks on its employees, and a little scouting and some patience would let a terror cell operating under your constraints put at least a dozen barristas on shift within sight of the White House (or the Capitol, or the NYSE) on the morning of a key workday. Now, all you need is a hyperpotent, odorless/flavorless toxin with a variable incubation period, and you could create a short-lived, highly specific outbreak of any malady you choose. The obvious first choice would be botulism, but that kills too fast and, since its anaerobic, is darn near impossible to cultivate, especially if the terror cell isn't of the bioengineering variety (it would also blow the budget). You also couldn't buy enough botox--which is sold in expensive, well-below-lethal doses--to do the job. So botulism is out. Polio would also be an ideal candidate, except that we innoculate against it. ""Mad Cow"" prions would also be great, but isolating them is also out-of-scope for our hypothetical terrorists. I'd recommend LSD, which can be bought on the street, is odorless and colorless (and bonds well to sugar) and has the advantage of chaos over lethality. Hordes of confused, traumatized victims distrusting of previous comfort source is the goal here--you don't want them dying before they've even elft the store. In any case, your target group would be the Starbucks demographic, which typically skews young, affluent, and highly educated as comapres to the general populace--precisely the demo for highly placed government staffers. All it takes is for a handful of press-worthy individuals (preferably somebody who has booked to a Sunday Morning flack program at least once) to freak out within the halls of power, and you've got a media firestorm in the nation's capital. Better yet, until the toxin and the attack vector are identified, everyone is looking through peepholes, trying to figure out what the basic facts of the attack are. As details leak out, the same demographic in other locales--namely the professors, business folk, hollywood types, and anyone with with both the disposable income and self-possessed image cosnciousness to buy a $5 cup of coffee--will wonder if they've been hit, and if they're next.

They could worsen things by some mouthpiece making outlandish/random demands.  The demands might be more demoralizing if they weren't all high-cost... they could be designed to make citizens question our 'we don't negotiate with terrorists' mindset.  Cost of such an operation is way under $500k... 25 nondescript cars, fifty guys staying in motels or whatever, and a few crates of hunting rifles. To make it good hollywood, when the good guys initially catch/kill the first-detected of these evil dudes, a plot twist would be to have the shooters be a couple of unrelated innocent joe-schmoes coerced into doing a single killing because family members were threatened. --------------- The thoroughly non-hollywood idea that used to scare an industrial-hygiene PhD I worked for: shutting down technical infrastructure using clouds of small carbon fibers.  He used various particles to model airflow in HVAC ducts, and one substance he used was short carbon fibers.  They are highly conductive, small and light enough to almost aerosolize themselves, and they short out electronic gear with a vengance... imagine tiny short circuits randomly between all those Surface-mount chip leads.   Now, imagine that crap being dumped over Wall Street or anywhere else that has both high profile and lots of computers or telecom gear. Once things short out from these fibers, they SOMETIMES are recoverable after washing repeatedly.  Most times, the damage is permanent. Oh, and because a decade has quietly gone by since I learned of carbon fibers, I did some googling... turns out that Janes and other Defense geeks have discussed an existing bomb based on tech related to this concept.  http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/dumb/blu-114.htm is one such article., and pics of Blu-114 are at http://cryptome.org/blu114-yu.htm",d2,2006-04-20 23:45:00
c54438,a000808,"I'll get to the movie plot momentarily; I think it's a reasonable and flexible one, and which my friends (who are mostly engineers or scientists) have talked about for a while over tea when we wanted to 'blue sky'.  
But a couple of comments on the terror profile:  1. There may have been 20-30 unskilled people directly involved in the 9/11 attack, but that set of people was underpinned by another host of underlings who helped make a lot of these things possible, and were further abstracted from the scene - some may not even have been in the USA at the time (of the attack or lead-up).  And - any operation like that requires a coordinator ... or a mastermind, if you like.  So the 20-30 unskilled people are on the ground, hands-on, and are basically expendable resources (of course easy to do with Islamic fundamentalists, if they are promised that all they have to do is blow up some infidels, take themselves out with the infidels, and then they get 70 virgins in perpetuity in Paradise - as if). 2. Terrorists are not known for their ethical behaviour, so they will not necessarily stick to a budget, either.  In fact, they can be quite parsimonious and decide they don't want to pay anything for anything.  
So, they steal, cheat, kidnap, etc., to achieve operational readiness, and this usually requires only a few weapons and accessories.  
Look at 9/11 - none of them said, 'Gee, a 767 costs [n] million dollars, but hey - that's above our budget - so we'll find another way to do make this thing happen....'  Or 'Our ethos is that we cannot kill people in the air, so we have to hijack empty planes....""  No - they stole/hijacked the planes with people in them to boot.  Easy - and cheap, and considering this as a system, it displays several layers of terror including what they actually did, not only enabling how they achieved their targets, but what they took with them to do it.   3.  This is the most important point.  I've read the 9/11 report, and have some military experience in this area.  And one thing that really chilled me about the 9/11 attacks was not that they attacked - the projection of terrorism is really only limited by money and opportunity - but rather what they attacked - basically what can be seen as (and I'm sure the terrorists see as)  America's ""gods"" were attacked, in line with the traditional mode of terrorism, to shake reliability of those ""gods"".  These targets were not random, and were attacks on commerce (WTC) and on the military (The Pentagon), which most Americans would have to admit are what they stand on when they think of themselves as nationally/culturally superior to other countries.   Today's terrorists may actually have a syncretic agenda (partially 'traditional' terrorist motivation, and partially sectarian or localised hate that they want to project outward as money and opportunity allow), but that makes them no less dangerous than a non-fundamentalist (or what some may call strictly a 'professional' terrorist - lol). -------- Start of scenario ----------- To the plot: Somewhere around 2020, nanotechnology has progressed to a point where nano-structuring is commonplace and the elements of a nano-structure can engage in low levels of ""hive"" intelligence.   
China has been progressing more swiftly than any other country and keeping their breakthroughs in this area under wraps, and so no-one else knows about this in the rest of the developed world.  The Chinese have developed the ability to construct programmable 'nano-devices' or 'nano-structures', have them de-resolve into what appears like really fine dust, release that de-resolved structure package into a general (target) area, such that the de-resolved bits (nanites) will all coalesce at a particular place back into that original nano-structure or device, to perform their programmed task at the programmed place or under the programmed conditions. The attack could come along a couple of axes as a start: 1) One set of nano-structures are designed to eat (through) high-grade steel (e.g., nuclear containment) structures (but also skyscrapers, bridges, tunnels, etc.), and in so doing enable themselves to replicate as they eat. 2. Another set of nano-structures is a multi-structure system.  These will become binary bombs when they restructure from the nanite form at a sensed target, and blow up immediately when they achieve their programmed environment.   They will be attracted by caffeine, which becomes the host, and will detonate when that combination then comes in combination with both caffeine and stomach acid in concert.  These will blow up coffee drinkers.  (I included this one because I like coffee), and would give a good local touch to what is otherwise a global scenario - think of the corporate boss and his directors at an early morning meeting, and all of them have their coffee and Krispy Kreme donuts, followed a few minutes later by executive mush all over the place in the boardroom).  Yummy. 3. Another set of nano-structures are designed to create large atmospheric disturbances by destabilising the electromagnetic balance of the earth's atmosphere, feeding on gamma radiation to grow and replicate themselves.  They would cause a massive electromagnetic storm that covers the planet, preluded by a lot of localised destruction leading up to the full-blown storm, and the swapping of North/South poles.  The resulting electromagnetic disruption would fry all electrical systems and render all electromagnetic devices useless. ... Noting - This could go to lots of other places, but regardless of what happens in addition in this scenario, of course terror ramps up pretty quickly (e.g., it only takes a couple of broad-banded threats that cross over political and societal boundaries to make it all come undone on a worldwide scale - it's a bit scary just how fragile it all really would be) and it then becomes a question of 'how much is more than enough', especially if these structures can replicate.   
This can be the problem with movies, as well - they tend not to end as quickly as the terrorism might end up having to go to achieve its goal.  But - I would end this movie plot with the nano-structures going out of control (another realism - mankind letting the genie out of the bottle too soon), and finishing off all life on the planet in some way that relates to a progression of the 'hive intelligence' into something else. Partially, this finish is because I've been getting sick to death lately of these 'end of the world' movies that don't deliver on their promise (e.g., 10.5, or the one about the super-volcano, and the last one about the killer electrical storms - the only reason I watched them was to see how - at least how the movie - saw the world ending(!) and they didn't deliver - not one).  
The way these movies already made go breeds a mentality (incurably humanistic and of course pollyanna) that mankind will *always* be able to wiggle his way out of trouble, but never sees to the other side of that question - what if we run across something that we can't fight - or defeat?  That would be The End. It wouldn't hurt any of us to consider that scenario, regardless of how we get there, before the real thing were to come along, even if it starts out as a bit of escapism, as most movies are today.   
Terrorism cannot be fairly treated as escapism, so making a movie about it at this level and trying to be real is perhaps not in the best taste ... but when has that made Hollywood blush?  As they say, no one has ever lost money under-estimating the mentality or morality of the viewing public.  But I suppose the good thing about this exercise is that, if we throw these scenarios out now, maybe even if they don't make 'good' movies (by whatever standard), they will at least expose a possible axis of real threat.  Picking the Chinese was not arbitrary; there are many who do believe that the Chinese, in another 30-40 years, will be a serious world security threat, albeit without the sort of restraint that the USA has had as the ascendant 'empire' of late. --------- End of scenario ---------
---------  If you are wondering about what this nano-stuff is all about or how nanotechnology might become quickly ubiquitous and very (too) powerful in anyone's hands, read some of Neal Stephenson's work, especially 'The Diamond Age', which is solely about nano-technology.  He probably has the best bead on what technology will be doing for (and to) us in the future, anywhere from 20-50 years from now.

Each movie contains the same message: that terrorists never do things the easy way; they always do things in patterns building up to a climax; and the more specific and narrowly-applicable a countermeasure is, the better. Characters who advocate broad countermeasures or countermeasures which don't infringe on peoples' daily activities are shown to be dangerous buffoons. Over time, since the decadent American populace gets all its opinions from Hollywood, America comes to focus all its efforts on ineffective countermeasures to imagined schemes that are too stupid for terrorists to use anyway. Terrorists rub their hands with glee. The day is saved by a bunch of Salt-Of-The-Earth Small Town Americans, who use common sense based on bizarre farming/ranching metaphors to see that Something Is Wrong. One of them happens to be the President's dad, and he reminds the President of his sensical, small-town roots and gets him to set up a special presidential commission that vets every movie produced by Hollywood to make sure it doesn't contain stupid terror plots.

c54669,a000808,"I like the Disney plots. Disneyland is iconically American (recursively so!), and it allows for lots of photogenic kids in the movie. Also, Movie America is a small place. It only has a few cities (LA, NYC, ""generic other eastern city"", one small town in the Midwest and another in Maine, and marginally Boston or DC). Disney is near LA. So here's a movie outline. Terrorists infiltrate Disneyland (for a movie, it'd have to be a pseudo-Disneyland with the serial numbers filed off) and work as the guys in the cartoon suits. With the big heads, nobody can tell if you have a ""terrorist beard"" or even a turban (gasp). The evil plan is that the President and First Lady are taking their Disney-age kids to D'land, along with a gaggle of disadvantaged but adorable kids who would never be able to afford to go otherwise. The terrorists will pull off their costumes' heads, open fire with machine guns, and demand concessions from the US. Our hero is someone who worked for the theme park, or DHS, or somewhere, but was laid off because The Economy Is Bad. Their job was offshored, thus paving the way for the infiltration (all furriners all same!). Our hero notices ominous incidents and eventually realizes what's going on, but of course nobody listens to him. Eventually he convinces people. By that time, it's the day of the plot and the terrorists are in place. The good guys have to sneak into D'land through the complicated maze of service tunnels beneath the park. Lots of Mission Impossible style stuff: avoiding laser beams, bypassing code locks, and so on, as the camera cuts back and forth between them, the group of kids, and the terrorists. Of course it comes down to a climactic hand-to-hand fight between our hero and the boss terrorist on a moving roller coaster. They trade an implausible number of blows. The terrorist slips and clings to the side of the car. The good guy (being the good guy) reaches out to save him, but the terrorist refuses and curses America with his last breath before being smacked by a passing support beam and falling to a gruesome death in the 'coaster machinery. The End. A movie is better if it can pander to more of the audience's fears. The whole ZOMG TERORRISTS!!1 plot is pretty good wingnut fodder, but we can add more. See, the theme park *wanted* to do background checks on its employees, but was stopped by a civil liberties group. Also, the city police have had their guns taken away by Evil Leftists. (scene: cop in position to take a shot at a terrorist, reaches for gun --- but doesnt have one! Ahhh!) I'm having a harder time coming up for a sop for the left in this plot, but how about this human interest angle. See, the hero's rebellious teenage daughter has been dating a swarthy (darkly handsome!) foreigner. He's always suspiciously close to an incident, and the audience is led to believe he's working with the terrorists, and dating the daughter in order to get close to the hero (who worked in security or something, remember). But it turns out he's actually working for foreign intelligence, or Interpol, or somebody, against the terrorists, and our hero *almost* screws the pooch by being xenophobic/racist and not trusting the guy at a critical moment. (Needless to say, in the final post-climactic scenes, after the terrorists have been defeated and the hero vindicated, the daughter stops dressing gothy/punkish and wears more girly clothes, thus subliminally (ha!) indicating that All Is Once More Right With The World. She's still dating the foreigner, who turns out to be of royal descent or something, and who no longer has scary background music. Also, he's an excellent Little League coach (america! apple pie! baseball! rah rah!) because he was a cricket star back home --- American audiences won't bother to keep track of the differences between Indians and Iraqis and Afghans and Saudis anyway.)",Wim L,2006-04-22 17:23:00

Information warfare plots. 1) We Don't Need No Stinkin' NCIC: a sophisticated cyberwar attack is launched against state and Federal criminal justice databases.  Peace officers nationwide start getting ""officer safety advisory: suspect armed and extremely dangerous"" hits when they run checks on concealed weapons permit holders and off-duty officers outside their own region.  When they stop dangerous suspects, their information and background comes back clear.  When they stop private citizens, the system works OK about 98% of the time -- just often enough that the ""red"" hits are convincing.  After a lot of cop-vs-permitee and cop-vs-cop shootouts, the database eats itself or is corrupted in lots of really annoying ways.  No one ever trusts a criminal records check again. 2) Background Checks Clear: as above, except for background checks for employment.  All of them.  Perhaps for a specific company or industry, such as hazmat truck drivers.  Implement secretly, verify results, and strike accordingly. 3) Telephone Terror: our sophisticated terrorist cell plugs discreetly into a number of COs around the country and starts crank calling.  Random members of the public, news media politicians, security / 911 / police / military operations centers, and just for fun, the White House Operator.  Sometimes they make threats, sometimes they report false plots.  Once in a while they call in a real incident just to keep people guessing.  Our plucky heroes find out all about the plot and try to report it -- but can't get past the terrorists, who are the tip of the iceberg for a few puzzled Indian call centers actually making the thousands of calls per minute.

With no ability to pay for anything, and no way to verify if an ATM or credit card is good, the millions of fake cards mailed two days prior start arriving in high-crime zip codes nationwide.

This continues indefinately until all teams are evenually caught. Once the press cotton on to what happens Mr John Doe knows that in X days it could be his family that is taken out with no warning.

for several days and the public will be hopeful that the ordeal is over, but eventually they will be found showing the police have failed.  Eventually a team will be caught, but again the attacks will continue. This has the potential to continue for months if not years. Are your family next? --

They could be propelled by a homemade pulse jet or gas-powered leaf blowers, bought at yard sales.  Planes will be targeted near hub airports because of the cascading effect of outages.

If in doubt, ask a combat engineer.  If you've ever seen the demolition of a building, you saw that it takes a lot of planning and coordination to cause the collapse.  Without it, you end up with a weakened but standing structure.  The WTC towers' collapse was a fluke, not by terrorist design.  The Oklahoma City federal building and the Pentagon were damaged but not tipped into structure failure and collapse. Disasters are caused by a chain of events.  Survival depends not on complete perfection of all aspects of a system but rather the prevention of just one event in the chain.  If not, disaster would be the everyday norm.  Most failures are because links in the chain are allowed to deteriorate shortening the chain and increasing risk of disaster.",Nikolai,2006-04-23 11:10:00

c54786,a000808,"I attacked the issue of knocking out the power for years and wrote an unpublished novel and screenplay for it. None of the methods in your 580 postings so far that talk about taking out the power grid get to the simple, cheap essence of it. I consulted with experts in the business. The secret is NOT knocking down transmission towers (that takes too much explosives), not part of the towers, not transformers, not cutting power lines with gas saws (too labor-intensive), not balloons (much too unwieldly and expensive), not taking out the power plants (generators can be replaced quickly). The weakest point in the system are the insulators. Those insulators hold up the wires. All you have to do is put a small amount of explosive on hundreds of insulators and the lines come down. It takes six weeks to repair several wires. The problem escalates geometrically when you have hundreds of wires down, to the point where it would take five years to restore power. In the meantime, the ripple effects of no power are devastating...to take just one example, gas pumps won't work, so transportation comes to a standstill. Key part of transportation is for food. Food doesn't get delivered. People starve. Electricity controls all the sewage plants. They don't operate, diseases like typhoid set in. Businesses, of course shut down, ruining the economy.

Glass vials of avian flu are smuggled by terrorists into the country by inserting them in rectums and vaginas. These are delivered to 5-6 obscure small chicken farms across the US previously bought at bankruptcy auctions after US family farms were forced out by ruthlessly competitive poultry corporations. Chickens are injected with the flu virus and then covertly added to the huge tightly packed corporate chicken production flocks a few days away from slaughter by planted workers. By the time it's realized that chickens are dropping dead by the tens of thousands, tens of thousands more have already been delivered and sold by chain supermarkets, fast food chains and restaurants across the country. Food preparation handlers, housewives and cooks spread the virus to co-workers, family and friends resulting in a massive epidemic that spreads like wildfire infecting hundreds of thousands in the course of just a few days. This includes the military, hospitals, police and firefighting forces, and FEMA and Homeland Security personnel. As the death tolls mount riots ensue and anyplace remotely connected to chickens is torched as people deemed responsible are dragged into the streets and beaten to death by angry mobs. The fate of the nation falls into the hands of a disparate group thrown together by the rapidly evolving and seemingly impossible to stop crisis. Characters include: Angry vindictive 22 year old son of displaced US farmer that died of heart attack after farm is repossessed and contacted terrorists with idea.

c54794,a000808,"The best spies and terrorists enter a country with nothing at all except a
valid passport and a credit card, knowing that they can buy everything they
need...   Petrol/Gas filling stations are everywhere and have tanks holding thousands
of litres of potential explosive.  When properly built these tanks are
perfectly safe and contrary to what some movies and TV drama may like you to
believe they are almost impossible to explode during a normal accident.    Most tool rental stores will stock boring tools that can cut large holes
through brick and concrete walls.  The tops of most petrol/gas tanks at filling stations are usually no more
than one meter below the ground surface and often are covered with just sand
or gravel and then a thin layer of concrete or tarmac.  Using one of the
boring tools to cut a couple of holes down into a full tank would be quite
simple (and with care quite safe.)     Into one of the holes is sealed the compressed air hose used for inflating
tyres (an extension hose may be required.) Into the other hole is sealed a
long pipe fitted with a shower head to create a fine spray.  The pipe must
extend to the bottom of the tank to ensure that the air pressure will force
out the fuel.     A simple ignition device on a timer is placed on the ground and the air
compressor switched on.  Fuel-air explosions are not very efficient but the
availability of large amounts of fuel and the slow explosion velocity is
highly damaging to surrounding buildings.    Ideally the attack should take place at night and the filling station should
be closed but if necessary the attendants will have to be dealt with.  The
ignition time should be just after dawn for best results.   A team of 30 could, with practise, prepare five to ten filling stations in
one night.  Total cost for the hire of the tools, bits of plumbing and some hose would
be less than $5000 leaving $495,000 for the wrap party. ",Geoff Lane,2006-04-23 14:19:00
c54800,a000808,"Lifts have very reliable safety mechanisms and are the safest means of
transport by far.  Damaging the lifting gear would be disruptive but not
terribly terrifying.   One day during the morning rush when they are crowded 16 suicide bombers
enter a lift in each of the 16 tallest buildings in the US.  Each carries a
briefcase full of explosive which they trigger as soon as the doors close.
An FBI agent, our hero, starts an investigation.    The remaining 16 terrorists lay low for a year by which time all the
security searches that were instigated after the original bombings have been
abandoned or are so lax as to be useless. The hero fights for better
resources but is mostly ignored.    The next attack takes place on the same day as the first and consists of 8
larger bombs in subway carriages, buses and trains.  Again the attack is
during the rush hour, again the intent is terror and disruption.  The hero
is vindicated and gains backing and resources and Secret Service help.    Exactly year later the next attack consists of four suicide bombers in
restaurants.  By now the hero has sufficient clues to start searching
backwards for connections and is leading a major investigation task force
but making little progress.    The following year there is no attack but the expectation is so high that
normal life is impossible on that day.  Having predicted mayhem the hero
is now disgraced and in future can only work on the case in his spare time.   The final year consists of the remaining four terrorists packing high
explosives into three small cars and fitting them with motion detectors.
The motion detectors are used to detect when the cars come to a halt --
think of Speed.    A car transporter is stolen and given some bullet proofing, sufficient for
the transporter and driver to survive sustained firing for a few seconds.
The transporter mechanism is locked down so it creates a ramp.  The idea is
that the transporter is driven up to a well known sensitive area that is
protected by fences, concrete barriers and armed guards where it can be used
as a ramp by the cars which are driven at high speed up the ramp and over
all the barriers.  If any of the cars survive the jump they will race
towards their final target.  In any case, when the cars stop, they blow up.         But this is a movie plot, so the hero has to work out the pattern and work
backwards to the point early in the story where the terrorists made a
mistake that leads to the final four being identified before the attack. The
hero and his Secret Service buddy set up a defence within the grounds
consisting of well hidden aeroplane catch netting which is used to stop the
cars, which then explode but well away from the intended target.  The hero
emerges burnt, bruised but victorious.       I wonder if Bruce Willis is available?  If not, Jerry Doyle would do. ",Geoff Lane,2006-04-23 16:03:00
c54803,a000808,"Admittedly, the power grid model has been played but I would like to think of this as a more coordinated plan.  Having been a Registered Nurse and a member of DMAT (Disaster Medical Assistance Team) it becomes real clear how all of this works presuming that some part of the infrastructure this country is based upon is operational.  The plot I have devised here is based on 20-30 men and $500,000.  Double the men and money, create a second team to go after the fuel system and the US will be stopped for years. What follows is what I have developed. Soldier --------------------------------------  The Plot By Soldier
22 April 2006  Overview: Security is an illiusion. Almost all security systems are operated and controlled by computers and are linked by dedicated communications systems, thus they all have a common weakness.  Power.  Despite battery backups and generators there is a limit to how long such means are sustainable.  A large scale failure of the power grid, coupled with small scale attacks with bio-weapons will cause panic. The bio-weapons need not be lethal, the terrorists don’t want them to be lethal, just highly infectious.  The object of the terrorist is to instill fear, to make your enemy use up his resources to fight you, or even better, to get the enemy to fight amongst themselves.  The problem will be there won’t be an enemy to fight. Opening: A security room in a bank is going through change of shift when the power fails.  Within a few seconds the lights come back on but it is clear they are running on an internal generator.  They start going through the process of securing the facility without power.  Five minutes later power is restored.  This was a dry run by the terrorists to see how operations would be handled in a major city if a few lines were cut down. 25 men, using old vans and cars bought cheap are driving around the United States with nothing conspicuous on them.  They look ‘normal’ and attract no attention.  The only unusual thing is when they stop at night they pull into  local stores and buy what they need for making low grade explosives.  They cook their product and drive out of town early in the morning to find a remote high tension wire tower.  They have maps that show where all of these lines run and a cleverly disguised diagram to show where to put the explosives. Each man operates alone and is wearing a chronograph watch.  Each bomb made is set to go off at a specific time.  The goal is to create power surges back through the line that shut down as many substations as possible and may even damage the grid.  One team of two men is driving an electric company truck from substation to substation along the east coast and especially in the New York  and D.C. area planting devices in control panels.  The objective is to make it a difficult and dangerous process to repair the damage without making it impossible. After two weeks of driving around the countryside the terrorists meet at a hotel in Kansas City.  They have a conference planned and scheduled at the hotel.  One of their members brings in a tray with pitchers of what appears to be water but has botulism in it.  Each is poured a glass and the glasses passed around.  In a toast the leader raises his glass and says “God be praised!��?  Everyone responds “Insh’allah!��?.   They then break for lunch in the crowded restauraunt.  That afternoon they are each given new maps and leave the hotel and head off to every major city in the U.S., some by plane, some by car and some by train.  All of these men have new jobs they start on Monday in the restaurant business as cooks. Each man is a walking bio-weapon that will take three days to incubate.  They will then culture themselves onto agar plates and grow their own bio-weapons and spread it as far as possible before they are discovered.  While each man starts his day job it is expected to take two weeks before widespread infection occurs.  Ten days after drinking the water the power is going to go out. A line worker driving along a remote part of an access road stops to investigate something attached to a high tension wire tower.  A failure of the grid is caused by the toppling of 250 strategically chosen high tension wire towers in remote areas, coupled with the damaging of controls at substations.  The line worker recognizes it for what it is but the tower blows up before he can call it in. In a control room for the national power grid the controllers try to avoid the spike they see heading for the east coast as the power fails from west to east at the highest peak hour of summer.  Several substations fail to respond to commands from the control center and most of the country and the entire east coast goes dark.  The generators kick on but there isn’t enough sustainable energy to make everything work.  Communications become spotty and after 36 hours the only communication networks running are run by the military.  Fuel has become scarce as hoarding and looting start.  Batteries go quickly and the worst affected are the fire and EMS operations as the police don’t share their already overloaded system as the police try to coordinate civil order as society starts to break down. And then people start getting sick. Hospitals find themselves overrun with botulism cases.  People unable to get to hospitals start dying at home.  Hospitals burn through most of their resources in 24 hours because they stock on a “just in time��? model for cost savings and do not have sufficient resources on site to handle such a crisis.  Antibiotics become scarce and the children, least capable of coping with the disease, start dying.  Rumours of a contaminated water supply send New York spiralling into chaos. Meanwhile in Washington the President and the cabinet are unable to make quick changes to an already overtaxed system.  The military is slow to change gears from war to civil defense.  The billions spent on weapons systems now seem useless as thousands of Americans, mostly children and elderly, are dying for lack of care.  What started as a mild, locally isolated crisis in Portland, Oregon has in two weeks spread across the country and repairs to the power grid are being delayed by the inability to coordinate repairs. But what the terrorists hoped for didn’t happen. The President of the United States, in an International appeal asks the world for help.  Taking a big piece of humble pie he is required to acknowledge the US has not always dealt fairly with the rest of the world and promises to change.  The world responds in kind with medical supplies, food, material and fuel As many of the terrorists lay dying they wonder why other countries haven’t attacked America while they are down.  They feel btrayed.  Their leader makes calls to his paymasters to find out why the war hasn’t started yet.  Being the only satellite call being made at the time the call is a large beacon and is easily monitored by a listening station in Colorado at Fort Hauchucha.  This information is tracked backed to local Law Enforcement who attempt to arrest them.  The leader and his two chief henchmen have turned their hotel room into one very large bomb in the middle of their hotel and blow themselves up, taking a good chunk of the hotel and its guests with them. What the paymasters wanted was an apology from the United States for meddling in their affairs. They got it. And then the lights come back on in New York ",Soldier,2006-04-23 16:19:00

c54865,a000808,"@Jay Garmon mentioned botulism but then tossed the idea, due to the toxicity and the cost of generating it.
Firts botulism is really easy to develop, as it exists in the wild and creating an anaerobic environment is simple with some canning equipment. Botulism also takes from 18 to 36 hours to develop symptoms which means it could be spread and outbreaks would have a somewhat random pattern.  The variation to the plan is the delivery method.  Have 10 teams with $4000 a piece in ones that have been treated with the liquid.  Attend random events/locations that would allow for maximum distribution (street fairs, sporting events, malls).
Once the pattern became known, it would still take time as the initial infection vector is food.

At the airport, part of the team goes through security as normal, then sets up at pre-planned locations inside the airport. Then we need a 'ringer' to go through security.  They should have something innocuous but forbidden in their bag so they get pulled over by security.  Their job then is to make a fuss: tie up as many security agents as possible. Once the agents are distracted, the 'carriers' rush the gates, with their bags in hand.  They should spread dust bombs as they run.  (Put a couple in your path: the security gaurds who are chasing will probably pause before running through the dust cloud.) When they are about to get caught, the bags should be relayed to the next member of the group in the airport.  Repeat until you run out of people to pass the bags too.

Terrorist Movie Plot Contest Entry  There is a existing deadly virus, Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and a way to spread it (Mosquitoes in particular ""Culex pipiens"" ). Here is the outline for how they could be used to spread terror and lay waste to the U.S. economy and health using the proscribed ""30 terrorists with $500,000"". By Monta ""glad HE'S not a bad-guy"" Elkins
and Kirk ""Mosquito Man"" Averett  Background. Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) kills about one third of the people who become infected making it one of the most deadly mosquito-borne diseases in the United States. Approximately half of those who survive will have brain damage according to the Centers for Disease Control. http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/arbor/eeefact.htm The virus lives in host reservoirs- typically game birds. Mosquitoes become infected when biting those game birds. The mosquitoes then infect humans when they are bitten. Humans die. Phase One.  Pheasants seem to be the most susceptible domestically-reared game bird
http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/PS045
Though many other types of fowl could be used as well. Terrorists would seed likely mosquito breeding grounds with mosquitoes and an infected caged bird. Many potential mosquito breeding grounds exist, from ponds, to old tires, to junk yards. Anything that holds small amounts of water can be used.   Timeframe From egg to breeding adult can be as short as 7 days with warm weather (85-100 F) and a bit of organic material in the water for the larva to use as food (a bit of cattle feed would do it). Symptoms usually appear 4 to 10 days after the bite of an infected mosquito. That gives the 30 terrorists at least 11 days to drive and seed Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) across the country and perhaps as long as 20 days before the first cases appear. Assuming they can drive and seed 5 locations a day for 10 days thats 1500 mosquito sites. Those mosquitoes will continue to seek out breeding locations and other game birds to infect on their own. (And the terrorists will have other work to do after the 10th day- long before the first symptoms appear in the public- see Phase II). 12 days after the process begins people begin to present to hospitals with some ""unidentified viral encephalitis"". In 3 more days the trickle becomes a stream and the CDC is called to try to isolate the cause. The deaths are appearing in news reports and the public becomes fearful. In 2 more days the CDC has identified EEE and calls for mass spraying of the insecticide, malathion, nationwide to stop the mosquitoes. Even if enough trucks, and planes could found to kill every mosquito on the planet on this day; tens of thousands of people have already been infected for a week. ""Walking wounded."" The stream of infected arriving at medical facilities becomes a flood. Since there is NO effective treatment for EE 30% of them will die and 50% of the survivors will ultimately suffer brain damage. Malathion deteriorates rapidly in the environment due to sunshine and water, so spraying must be done daily. Cities, counties and states will ""fight"" over limited supplies of insecticides and the hundreds of thousands of vehicles and devices needs to administer it. Effect:
Hospitals are overwhelmed. People are afraid to leave their houses to go to work or shopping. Tens of thousands of people are called upon in the mosquito eradication attempts; leaving their regular productive endeavors. A significant portion of the work force either dies or becomes brain damaged, further crippling the economy. The national guard and armed forces are recalled from their duties in Iraq and elsewhere to operate the spraying machinery and fight the plague at home. EEE become endemic in the U.S. from this point on. A state of Emergency is declared by the President severely curtailing American liberties. Border and airline security measure are stepped up severely to make a show of the attempt to keep anyone from smuggling something as small as 1cc of a blood borne pathogen into the U.S.   Phase II
""The extremely small droplet aerosols utilized in adult mosquito control are designed to impact primarily on adult mosquitoes that are on the wing at the time of the application.""
http://www.mosquito.org/mosquito-information/virus.aspx   The terrorist stopped early in their seeding of natural, existing, breeding grounds of mosquitoes to develop some special, protected breeding areas. Inside and thus protected from the malathion spraying. The terrorists had each rented 3 (or more) widely separated apartments, in large cities across the U.S. In those apartments they build small plywood ""ponds"" covering most of the floor, lined with plastic sheeting; warmed with fish tank temperature controllers; seeded with mosquito larvae and food. 2-3 animals would be left in each apartment, with plenty of separate food & water for them. You would want them to live as long as possible. Only one would have to be infected initially-- the others would get infected pretty quickly. Pick ""low rent"" districts to keep the rent expense down, and maximize the number of apartment breeding grounds. Poorer neighborhoods would be less likely to notice the apartments and slower to search them when the Presidential order for landlords to search all rental properties ultimately comes. A hole in a window screen allows the mosquitoes to travel outside their warm protected home; infect people and other bird at large and seek additional breeding grounds. Mosquitoes travel up to a 14 mile diameter depending on species; essentially covering all of New York, New York, from 3 strategically placed apartments. The effects on the economy, freedom and feeling of security in the U.S. would be incalculable. Additional Options:
A)
Remove Phase I and begin with Phase II breeding in apartments. That would have less ""initial shock"", but might hide the infection method lounger since there would be no (dead) birds found caged near water sources. Authorities would spend many days waiting for the malathion spraying to take effect (remember it takes 4 to 10 days for symptoms to appear) and when it did not, many more solving the puzzle of rented breeding grounds in apartments.    B)
Before beginning, taint Consumer (Deet containing) anti-insect sprays with a nerve agent. Their procession through the supply chain will be greatly accelerated once the infection vector is discovered. A very small number of deaths from tainted insect sprays or spraying will cause a significant decline in their use when they are most needed; thus allowing more persons to become infected.  C)
Breed mosquitoes that are selected for malathion resistance before beginning.  D)
Careful planning and work would allow most of the terrorists to leave the area before the plot was revealed, leaving them alive become sleepers agents; waiting for the call to begin again. ",monta,2006-04-24 09:53:00

(Power grid + populace threat) Scene 1 A rented van drives from Spokane, Wa to a remote setting in Idaho and loads up with shoulder mounted rocket launchers and a couple of people dressed in fatigues. Scene 2 Terrorists dressed in ""delivery man"" garb take over the UPS cargo depot at the Spokane, Wa airport.  A van full of explosives is unloaded at the depot. Scene 3 Terrorists dressed in ""delivery man"" garb take over the UPS cargo depot at the 
Kamloops, BC, airport.  A van full of explosives is unloaded at the depot.  Scene 4 A van with mercenaries drives through the Idaho forests enroute to an unknown destination.  Receives cell communiqué that locations Alpha and Bravo are secured. Scene 5 UPS cargo plane lands in Kamloops and is met at the deopt by terrorists who overtake the plane and its crew.  Explosives are loaded aboard the aircraft. The same scene plays out in Spokane moments later, and that plane is loaded with explosives. Two pilots board each of the cargo planes and ask for takeoff instructions as night falls across the West. Scene 6 Two cargo jets go airborne from two separate locations. A van with four terrorists arrives at their destination, parked on an overlook ridge just after nightfall.  They use infrared glasses to scope the target.  The camera pans down and away from the van, exposing the target.  Grand Coulee dam. The cell phone rings and notification comes to the leader that ""Nighthawks alpha and bravo have launched"". Scene 7 Two radar operators in separate locations note with alarm that UPS cargo jets they have been tracking have dropped off the radar and may have crashed. Aboard each craft the pilots have turned off navigational radios and are flying on ""manual"" at low altitude.  One heading South, one heading North. Scene 8 Planes are closing in on the ""target"" and the rocket launcher crew goes to work.  With precision they strike lookout and defense positions on the dam, then target the office structures below. As they finish, a cargo jet approaches from the North at high velocity, slamming into the back side of the dam just above the waterline and exploding, shuddering the earth.  A large portion of the center-toip of the dam is missing.  Within seconds a cargo plane coming from the South slams into the front face of the dam, closer to the base, and explodes in a blinding flash, shuddering the earth. In moments, the dam begins to fail, and a final volley from four rocket launchers on the hill above helps break open the face of the dam. The 40-mile long lake Roosevelt begins to pour down the Columbia River valley, uncontrolled.  No warning is given to the dams downriver, other than the generation at G.C. is now offline. Scene 8 Through the night the surging wall of water roars down the Columbia waterway, overtopping dam after dam and gaining momentum (and huge amounts of water) along the way.  The cities of Wenatchee and Kennewick are inundated and largely swept away. A van of renegade’s retreats to Northern Idaho to hide. Scene 9 As day breaks in the West, there is no power from Seattle to Los Angeles.  The Western power grid has failed. Commerce has ground to a halt west of the Rocky Mountains. Water is sweeping down the Columbia river gorge threatening to overtop Bonneville dam and wipe out the large metro area of Portland, Or. Scene 9 Bin Laden releases a video on Al Jazeera that claims victory over the Americans. Scene 10 Pandemonium, as water sweeps into a panicked Portland, Oregon, washing all away in its path, and surging water well up the Willamette valley.

by poisoining a large number of people while disrupting communications of said city  Claims 1) Select a city and an appropriate date and time.
2) Get a potent, water-soluble, tasteless, odourless and invisible poison (e.g., LSD).
3) Develop an electronically controlled small poison pump that can inject poison into water pipes.  This can be accomplished by :
a) Developing a special fixture for PVC water pipes serving buildings.  A section of the pipe is covered with a ring (to contain pressure), and a hole is drilled into pipe.  The ring contains a nozzle attached to the pump.
b) Develop a kind of hoses that can be inserted from the faucets.
4) Attach 100 such devices to pipes in various buildings.
5) Build 500 radio jammers capable of jamming various bands -- emergency, cellular and spread them across the city.
6) The jammers and pumps are set to go off a given date.
7) For profit, you can blackmail the government and give them the locations for a few of these pumps.
8) Take appropriate care to put the jammers and pumps near large metallic masses and electric lines.  
Also, use proper design and shielding techniques to ensure they have a very quiet electromagnetic signature.  This way they should be hard to spot.
9) To make sure no-one else takes ``credit'' for your efforts, post appropriately encrypted messages to the usenet or various blogs, possibly using steganography.  You could, for instance, write a very nice freeware or open-source game and hide the messages in it.

and there is a lull and malaise in their activities.   The ringleader / masterminds are also weary, having not accomplished anything they consider memorable,
and so, they decide that this time, *they* and not the younger recruits are going to carry out the plot.  The Target:  - the bridges and  tunnels of a few major American cities The Plan:  - the people involved dress as successful middle aged businessmen, in suits and ties,
and drive expensive but not ostentatious bmw's, in keeping with an affluent urban image  -they assume that this is not the terrorist profile that the screeners will be looking for,
and that they will be allowed through normal traffic without being stopped and having their vehicles searched  -they accumulate a large supply of highly flammable materials, paint thinner, acetone, solvents,
easily acquired in any Home Depot or similar chain store  -they purchase all the 'ordinary' materials necessary for a 'do-it-yourself' home renovation project,
so that the flammable materials are plausibly part of the project, and do not trigger any alerts or investigations.  -once they have stockpiled enough flammable materials to fill their trunks, they arrange on a date and time for a spontaneous
attack, where they drive full speed into a head on collision with one of the bridge towers or tunnel walls  -they communicate steganographically by using spam messages as the cover carrier, and an agreed upon simple poly-alphabetic substitution cipher to hide short text messages within the spam -- they use common anonymous spam e-mail addresses with yahoo, hotmail, etc. domains,
and the sender makes a new address for each message, sent to the receivers' legitimate 'respectable' e-mail addresses  -- the e-mails are deleted immediately after being read, as expected of spam -- no non-terrorists are spammed, so there is no spam-abuse triggered investigation -- [steganography is used because all the known cryptographer consultants have dismissed it as 'less-than-respectable crypto',
 and have asserted time and again that steganography has never, and probably never  would be, used by terrorists  ;-)  ]  The Twist and Happy Ending:
(sorry, but i can't bring myself to write something where the terrorists do anything but lose  ;-))  )   -in one of the cities, on the day of the attack, there is unusually heavy traffic,
and one of the terrorists starts out early, so that he can be at the tower of the bridge at the appointed time.  - on one of the merging lanes approaching one of the bridges,
 an aggressive motorist in a hurry, has a mild scrape with one of the terrorist bmw's.  -the motorist gets out of his car and starts yelling at the bmw driver, claiming that it was the bmw driver's fault - to his surprise, the terrorist driver of the bmw, who doesn't really care anymore about money or possessions,
offers to pay a generous amount of cash on the spot to settle it, saying that his insurance would go up more, if he had to report it  -at this point, the police, who are routinely stationed at such bridges at rush hours, arrive,
and the motorist at fault starts speaking loudly to the police, telling them that it was all the bmw driver's fault,
and says, "" Look, he even offered to pay me cash for the damage, that must prove he  knows it was his fault.
If it were 'my' bmw and someone did that to me, I would be screaming my head off!""    - the police do find some merit in this line of reasoning,
and also have a bad feeling about the frustrated and panicked look on the bmw driver's face,
and decide to investigate more closely, 
and see him trying to light a match to set to a short fuse leading to the trunk.    --they overpower him just in time,

and the bridges and tunnels of major cities might be the new targets ...   then, 
with a marvelous efficiency and inter-agency co-operation of all personnel,
this is communicated to the tunnel and bridge authorities in all the major cities,

c55008,a000808,"If you really want to make an impression on the American nation, the way to do it is to sink an aircraft carrier. Better still, sink an aircraft carrier and make a video of the attack for propaganda.
Now on the face of it, knocking out a carrier is difficult, but I think there might be a small chance as follows:  A. Analyse global carrier delpoyments to work out where they regularly pass through shallow waters. Bottlenecks such as the Straights of Gibraltar or the approach channels to any harbours regularly used by carriers might be candidates. The point is to find a relatively shallow stretch of water where a carrier is likely to go, sooner or later. B. Upon confirmation of an approaching carrier, Sink a large quantity of compressed LPG gas cylinders, clad in explosive designed to rupture the gas cylinders, in the expected path of the carrier. What is a ""large quantity""? Well I am thinking of (say) 500 47kg propane cylinders giving 23,500kg compressed gas. The gas will expand by a factor of 250 when released (http://www.lpga.co.uk/fr_ab_lp.htm). C. When the carrier is sailing over the sunk gas cylinders detonate the explosives to release the compressed gas. Note that we are not interested in the potential explosive force of the gas when detonated in oxygen - we just want to release as much gas as possible under the ship to force it down in the water. A few notes: 1. Perhaps you don't ""get"" this. Normal ship buoyancy relies on the weight of displaced water by a ship. If the water under the ship contains enough rising gas, then the ship will sink. The only question is how much gas is required to achieve this result. 2. If the attack is carried out on a ship approaching a harbour, there should be a chance to get the attack on video. 3. As far as I know, no warship has ever been designed to defend against this type of attack. The only possible defence I can see is to keep the ship sealed airtight so that it will float back up after the gas has bubbled up to the surface. 4. LPG has been suggested because it is easily commercially available. There may be other compressed gases, such as normal air, that have better liquid/gas compression ratios and hence are more suitable for this type of attack. 5. Buying enough LPG gas to achieve this aim would be very expensive today. Perhaps a bit of old-fashioned fraud or even theft would be better than purachsing the gas (after all who wil look for it underwater). 6. Reliably blowing up the gas cylinders under (say) several hundred feet of water would be hard. The only chance I see is a command line laid from the sunk gas to a control point. This is definitely a weak point in the attack. Just to clear up any potential misunderstandings, I have no interest in terrorism - just security.",Pat Sutlaw,2006-04-24 17:43:00

Since the movie needs high-tech, we can show them keeping in touch via e-mail using nearly-unbreakable cryptography based on biometrics (i.e., they all have laptops with fingerprint scanners). At a prearranged time, part of each team quietly infiltrates mass-transit buses headed toward shopping malls.  The terrorist replaces the driver at the depot before the bus leaves, so the passengers have no idea what's going on.  The remainder of each team purchases/steals/makes armed-mall-security-guard uniforms and slips into each mall. The driver (wearning an explosive vest of course) drives into the mall through a large, plate-glass window and detonates the vest, sending a diesel fireball into the surrounding crowd, incinerating the bus and all passengers.  On cue, the disguised fake guards open fire on the screaming crowd, causing further panic, confusion, and loss of life.  This is repeated in the 10 largest malls across the country.  The country grinds to a halt as panic ensues -- Americans no longer trust public transportation (and, by extension, taxis), they fear police and security guards, and refuse to go shopping. If we need a happy ending, we can have a sexy FBI agent and a bookish-yet-handsome male counterpart find one of the laptops and lift a terrorist's fingerprint from a bathroom mirror.  They break the encryption at the last minute and manage to save the Mall of America before the final attack is completed.

Those that ignore the threat will be easy targets, they can be killed by blowing up their house, sniping them at work, etc. Those that attempt to flee will have to be followed.  Most likely, they will go to family or friends, in which case, it is most effective to kill whoever they flee to as well.  Of course, collateral damage would be desirable, but not essential. Those that seek police protection would require something like a suicide car bomb (with a timer on the bomb in case the bomber is shot through the head), or storming the location with machine guns and RPG's.

c55105,a000808,"My movie plot has a nice twist to it in that it does have a big impact but without causing many physical casualties. The assault focusses on a multi-vector attack on two primary targets, ammended by some decoys (to divert attention). The primary targets are both the national bank and the stock market.   As decoys, 2 major US banks are selected.  Two teams of 5 people get fake credentials that allow them to penetrate the infrastructure of the decoy targets (the banks).  The real target is their IT infrastructure, so there may be a backdoor to get them in through external IT suppliers or management/backup firms.  We do not need to hit these very hard as the target is to grab attention.  
The infiltration attempts to gain enough access to nock out the bank computers for at least 1 day, a nice bonus is to get their ATM systems down too.  For the primary targets, a lot of preparation and recon is needed.  The objective is to disable or at least permanently cripple them.  
Each target is assigned a team of 10 people, a good proportion of funding is used in providing them with fake backgrounds, IT and financial training and in selecting and hiring black hat hackers and rogue financial consultants and to purchase information.  After the initial recon and armed with technical details about the working of the IT infrastructure, our infiltrants start to penetrate both organisations.  Secondly, a team of our people and hired blackhats start working on a very specific computer virus to attack our targets digitally. Subteams for the primary targets find out information about the physical layout of the computer infrastructure for the targets, including datacenter location and backup centers.  They infiltrate as far as possible to get access to them, or at least get near to them. On the big day, very early in the morning (think 05:00 or 06:00), the decoys get attacked knocking most of the bank infrastructure offline.  This can be by physically blowing up power relays or networking hubs or electronicly or a combination of both.  The objective is to disrupt, not to destroy. In the subsequent (still mild) chaos, a digital attack (our virus) targets the stock market shortly after opening and the national bank.  This will disrupt financial transactions quite quickly.
When the chaos of both previous events is coming into effect, the infiltration teams start their work targetting in parallel the datacenters and their backups of the primary targets.  The idea here is no longer to cause disruptions, but to actually destroy the equipment beyond repair.  They more damage, the better for the attack scenario.  Though this attack causes little physical damage compared to other, more spectacular attacks, it will have a profound effect on a country like the US that is dependent on its corporations and corporations work largely based on the stock market and the financial market.
By striking both at once, trading will at least come to a temporary halt and maybe even permanently.  With all this data lost or at least inaccessible for a long time, a lot of corporations will fail, resulting in a cascading failure on the economy.  ",Nocturn,2006-04-25 06:11:00

No high profile targets, just ordinary towns where ordinary people go about their lives. Then the terrorists would detonate each bomb one after the other, ideally picking a part of the day in each state or timezone when the streets would be busiest. The result would be death and injury across the country. You'd get a sense of the authorities being unable to cope with the spread of attacks. The media would spend the initial period after the bombs dashing from one place to another in an effort to cover the story. This would increase the sense of dislocation and confusion. Those hurt would not be living or working in high-profile targets. So the resultant sense would be that nowhere is safe - maximum terror. An added bonus would be that the government would probably panic and introduce all sorts of pervasive repressive liberty-curtailing legislation, increasing the levels of fear in society and further undermining the American way of life. If the terrorists could recruit some disaffected American young men as part of the group that would be even more effective. As it would lead to American suspecting American everywhere they go. In fact, I'm scaring myself as I write this...",Richard,2006-04-25 11:41:00
c55184,a000808,"Just as Jonathan has said earlier, my idea was to have terrorists infect themselves with some virus. Have two groups one to infect the public, but another that gets close to aids, drivers, house keepers, support personnel to the President, VP, key members of Congress, and Supreme Court. This would cause panic as our leaders and population succumb to an epidemic. As quarantines are set up and flights in and out of our country are halted. The main plot could focus on a joint cast of CDC, Military, and Militia personnel trying to isolate the virus find a treatment and stop an impending U.S. revolution by sleeper cells that have been here for years waiting for this. Trying to hold the terrorists back would be overwhelming because our Military would be stretched thin because they would have to have a significant presence in every major city to inforce quarantines and keep order, their numbers would also be decimated by the virus. This would lead to a basic militia style system of ordinary men and women picking up what ever weapons they had to defend our country. In the end Americans would prevail and although there would be hundreds of thousands of casualties our contry would survive.",Clint,2006-04-25 12:41:00
c55185,a000808,"1 million people travel the waterways from the lower 48 states to alaska each summer in kayaks to cruise ships. Scattered along that route are cities, small towns, mining/lumber and fishing camps. Every mining camp has explosives as does every construction site. The coast is rocky and rugged and between  isolated points of civilization there is nothing but beatiful scenery, beautiful in nice weather. There are parts of the route that run inland, miles from open ocean, sometimes miles wide, sometimes the passage can be measured in 10s to a few hundred yards. Everywhere there is tidal current. Take Akbar and Mohamet to  intelligent kids from Seatle who have a knowledge of boats. They know where the explosives are and how to run a small fishing vessel.  Like most Americans of their generation they know computers, navigation and GPS comes easy. Remember that in narrow points of the inside passage cruise ships line up to navigate the ""choke points"". Limited room to maneouver and ever present current to negotiate. Too deep to anchor. Some days of the week liners are are only 15 minutes apart. They take one ship each? One ship sunk and the cruise industry will loose billions. A soft target. Plenty of assets availible for the taking. A lot of innocent boat traffic. Too big an area to police. Limited rescue assets. A potential to have 1000's of witnesses with cameras and communication. Looks like a target to me.",Coastal boy.,2006-04-25 12:51:00
c55196,a000808,"How about this one: Terrorists undertake training to fly airplanes.  (Like that's never happened before.)  They plot to take over cargo jets by, get this, shipping themselves via UPS or Fedex.  Once on the airplanes, inside boxes, they cut themselves free, and storm the cockpit.  From here, it's pick-your-target time.  White House, Super Bowl, Sky Scrapers, whatever. For planning, they need to determine the routes that the air carriers send packages via.  So, they send numerous packages with altimeters in them.  Those that reach > 3000 feet (and aren't destined for Denver) are assumed to be sent via air.  (GPS won't work because of the surrounding airplane and cargo.) Then, having determined the methods of sending packages that guarantee boarding airplanes, they label their cargo as biological (thus guaranteeing it is pressurized) or enclose an oxygen supply.  They sit and wait, watching their altimeters, until finally the moment arrives, and they exit their confines to take over the planes, using guns which they carried on their persons, and torches to cut through any security measures on the doors (if any). They coordinate with other planes via satellite phone, and when the time is right, they plow their aircraft into interesting targets.  Large dams, stadiums with people in them, maybe the Empire State Building (which will probably survive, but the point is to make a statement).  Definitely the White House and Capitol Building.  Maybe a few crowded airport terminals, just to be thorough. I figure they can take down ten or twenty targets given enough participants, and instead of having to deal with planes full of people they only have to deal with small flight crews.  The availability of guns on cargo flights makes it possible to use only one or two terrorists per flight, thus permitting many simultaneous captures.",jmr,2006-04-25 14:40:00
c55209,a000808,"The Poisoners In preparation the four smartest terrorists are sent to good universities outside of the US. Three study chemical engineering with a focus on synthesis, and one studies toxicology. Cost: $200,000. They return to their homeland to begin the execution of their plan in earnest. The first stage of the plan takes place in Iran, backwoods Pakistan, or any other place where the terrorists can operate and train with relative impunity. The build a modern chemical synthesis lab and begin producing highly toxic poisons (e.g. saxitoxin, ricin, mustard gas, etc).These are all fairly easy to produce with inexpensive supplies and standard university training.  Cost : $100,000 Stage two involves the entire team getting into the US with a stockpile of poison. The poison is easily concealed and a few kilograms would be enough for the mission. We'll allocate $100,000 for smuggling costs to make sure we get it right. Next the team gets transport and spilts up, traveling to mid to large size cities across the continental US. On a prearranged schedule the members go around to grocery stores with fine syringes, poisoning a specific type of food each week. One week it is cheese, the next week bacon. If poeple begin turning to delivery groceries hijack delivery trucks and poison everything inside before delivery. After a while grocery store security is too tight and team members start to get caught. At this point the remiaing members switch to gas attacks targeting the air intakes of large buildings. Often you only need to get to the roof to get access to these systems. More team members get caught, leading to the final operation involving poisoning the water supply of mid-size or small towns, one by one until each terrorist is caught. The advantages of this plan are that everyone has to eat, so targeting normal food produces a very powerful fear. In addition, many foods can be poisoned without tell-tale signs of tampering, allowing you to target a lot of people at very low risk. Every Arab in America has to go to the grocery store sometime, so profiling will give so many false leads as to be useless. Poison gas is also incredibly scary, mostly because ordinary people have no defense against it. Finally, poison water can cause the largest amount of casualities.",ChemGuy,2006-04-25 15:32:00
c55212,a000808,"A Summer Sunday, early evening.
All around the city 25 pairs of terrorists are completing their
preparations.  Each pair has a large, stolen four-wheel drive car internally
fitted with home made armour.  Into the car they have packed a large number
of grenades, guns and ammo and a large suicide charge with a timer which
will eventually cause an explosion should it not be triggered by a
terrorist.  The terrorists perform a final check, put on their army surplus
body protection and helmets.  They are ready.        Same day, one hour later.
The terrorists have moved to their initial positions and are listening to
the radio.  They are calm and do not talk.  Each has said goodbye to their
family and friends in letters and videos that will be delivered on Monday
morning.  The music on the radio ends and the news starts.  It is time to
go. Their routes are all similar, starting at the edge of the city they will
each travel through populated areas and converge on the central target.  If
any pair survives the journey, which is only three miles or so, they attack
the final objective.  There is no intention that any of them should survive
the next 15 minutes.          Five minutes later.
Each vehicle is positioned at the start its route.  Guns are checked. Seat
belts are tightened. Helmets are put on.  It's quiet, not much traffic.  The
sun is setting. People are walking, enjoying the pleasant evening.  Outside
coffee shops there are tables and chairs full of chatting customers.  There
are queues at the movie houses. There is no hurry, driving at 30 miles an
hour it will take less than 10 minutes to reach the target.       The first minute of the attack was the most deadly, nobody was aware what
was happening as the world exploded around them.  A couple of grenades fired
into a coffee shop kills or wounds fifty people and sets fire to the
building.  Automatic gun fire directed at a movie queue kills at least a
hundred people in 10 seconds.  Around the city 10,000 people are killed or
wounded before the first panic phone call is received by the police.      A minute later.
Two of the terrorist cars are stopped by head on collisions with other cars
driven by brave, but now dead, drivers.  Through the steam from the radiators
the terrorists make their stand.  When all their grenades and ammo is gone
they explode the suicide charge.  One of the explosions brings down an old
building blocking the road; by bad luck it isolates one of the largest ER
hospitals in the city.        A minute later.
Another pair of terrorists is dead, a grenade misfire killed the pair and
the car crashed into shop front.  In 15 minutes it will explode, destroying
the building and killing a large number of people crowding round to see what
they could see.     A minute later.
The police are now activated in force, but it's a Sunday and there are just
not many immediately available.  There are frantic efforts to get a general
warning broadcast on the local radio but nobody at the radio station is
answering the phone -- the system is now automated and run over cables from
a town 120 miles away and nobody can find the phone number.  An old beat cop
finally remembers the air attack warning system from the 1950s and shoots
off the rusted locks from the box containing the switch.  A mornfull wail
starts throughout the city, but will anybody understand its meaning?         A minute later.
Human targets are now few and far between.  Most people have moved off the
main streets but there is a lot of mostly ineffective small arms fire from
buildings. Lucky shots take out the tires of five terrorist vehicles which
slows them down a little.  The stream of reports to the police is now
massive, overwhelming, but a pattern is emerging which allows a plot to be
made on the city map and so the final objective is now obvious.       A minute later.
The lack of human targets allows the terrorists to speed up and they are
almost in sight of their target.  But by now the police are putting the
major ground attack defence plan into action.  Remotely controlled road
blocks are activated and many of them operate as planned, raising bollards
from the road surface to stop traffic.  Police and military stationed within
the central part of the city have reached their emergency stations and have
set up RPG launchers in killing areas around the final objective.  As each
of the terrorist cars reaches a set of bollards, a second set are raised
behind them, trapping them and they are killed with RPGs. Unfortunately
some of the terrorists set off their suicide bombs and some are triggered by
the RPGs.  Some explode a few minutes later when the timers trigger them.            A minute later.
All the terrorists are dead.  Total casualties approach 15,000. Large parts
of the city are alight.  The hospitals are overwhelmed.   Ten minutes later.
Six of the remaining terrorist cars explode destroying or damaging many
building.   Last Scene. The old beat cop is standing in a road.  As the camera pans around from his
face we see what he sees.  Collapsed buildings, fires, emergency vehicles as
far as the eye can see.   If possible the old beat cop should be played by Sean Connery. ",Geoff Lane,2006-04-25 15:49:00

c55215,a000808,"Bruce Schneier's Terrorist movie plots contest.
How to do the most damage to the U.S. with 30 people and $500,000.  Everyone is afraid of burning to death (at least the people that I've asked are ;) ) This plot requires primarily a small set of tanks used for an oxyacetylene torch welding; and perhaps a trash can for each of 30 terrorists.  (The other $400,000 can be used as a reward to the families of the terrorists as a recruitment bonus). It Begins with a spark.  At 3:00 a.m. in the morning on a weekday, the terrorist shows up at a high rise hotel with his oxyacetylene torch tanks hidden in a standard, plastic, rolling 30 gallon garbage can.  Dressed as a maintenance worker he approaches the rear door.  Lighting the torch he welds a small bead between the metal door and metal door frame.  The process takes less than 5 minutes and the door subsequently resists any ""unarmed"" human attempt at opening it.  He walks around to the other rear and side doors, welding each of them shut.  The whole process has taken under half an hour while virtually everyone was asleep.  He makes his way to the front of the building.  He quickly dumps his load of kerosene soaked wood and paper out of his trash can, and into the lobby; probably on the nearby couches, chairs, or the wooden main desk. He lights it with the torch.  He hangs the torch on the tank with the flame directed at the oxygen tank.  He leaves the torch in the already burning lobby while he makes his hasty exit. The hotel staff of 2, awake in the lobby in the wee morning hours, make it out without life threatening burns after pulling a fire call-box.  The fire alarms go off.  The kerosene soaked materials quickly grow into large flames.  In minutes most of the occupants have woken from their slumber, got their bearings and are stampeding to the exits.  (The complacent and sound sleepers die will soon die in their rooms).  The ones reaching the front door encounter the flames and turn around and head toward the rear where people are already piling up behind the rear doors- welded shut.  Some kids are crushed- lifeless in onslaught, long before the toxic smoke reaches the area to suffocate the remainder.  The sprinkler is triggered and the flames are retarded somewhat until the oxygen tank, finally cut by the still active torch, explodes.  The resulting oxygen in the already flaming room triggers a fuel/air type explosion; killing all those in the immediate vicinity- (many of which were still heading towards the front door.)  The resulting ball of fire ignites the walls and other materials away from and overwhelming the spray from the sprinklers also triggered by the explosion. Firefighters  When firefighters eventually arrive the front entrance is hopeless; scores are dead and hundreds are dying.  Nearly a thousand total die from flames and toxic smoke while the fire fighters spend precious minutes using the jaws of life, and even axes to beat open the doors that have been welded closed.  Although the ingenious firefighters opened the doors within a handful of minutes of arriving, the damages has already been done.  For the majority of the people trapped inside to have a chance of surviving they should have exited the building under their own power long before the first fire truck arrived.  The firemen enter, climbing over the bodies of the crushed and asphyxiated near the doors looking for those remaining few that have a chance of survival. The Toll  Repeat this scene 30 times simultaneously across the U.S. on one night. Assume 5 of the 30 are caught and stopped by inquisitive night-time hotel staff before the deed is done.  (A very generous estimate). Also assume the remaining 25 fires kill 800 people on average for a death toll of 20,000 mostly business travelers-- it was a week day after all.  (Over six times the deaths from the 9/11 attacks). Lather; Rinse; Repeat  Disappear for a few days, allowing people to loose a little vigilance- but re-appear before security guards can be hired at all hotels.  Repeat the process.  Once again there are over 10,000 dead in the United States.  In the media, bedlam ensues, equivalent to the fuel/air explosions in the lobbies of the doomed motels. Tourism stops.  Business travels refuse to travel.  The travel and tourism industry collapses while any business with traveling sales, or engineering teams (or the like) become incredibly less efficient.  No five minute period can pass without overhearing talk and wild speculation about the terrorists, from the radio, T.V., chain e-mails, and passers-by. ""Productive"" employers are robbed wholesale by security companies trying to hire enough staff to watch every motel 24x7 if not every door.  The President declares a state of emergency.  The national guard is recalled from Iraq to protect the homeland. Change targets:  Melt away again for a few days- the remaining 10 terrorists or so, yet uncaught, attack (for variety) nursing homes, hospitals, and college dormitories.  Thousands and thousands die yet again.  All Universities are immediately closed by Presidential Order until such time as the state of emergency is declared to be over.  The Army is recalled from Iraq to protect the hospitals and nursing homes.  People refuse to leave their homes overnight for any reason.  Conferences and business meetings are canceled nationwide. Terrorist cells grow quickly in the vacuum left in Iraq... Aftermath: The disruption to ""business as usual"" causes a similar disruption in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) that begins a long slide from inflation (due to the initial increase costs of doing business) to depression.

As planes are far away from the transmitters it should be easy to block any comm. & nav using, let’ s say a 4 Watt device blocking this range. (2nd plot could be to take over the commands from ground, you only have to talk over the right frequency).
Take 30 untrained people getting this blocking device on the plane (undetectable, you can hide it in a radio, a laptop, a toy if you want, unless power is switched on, you don’t know, what it is).
Have these 30 people be on a plane for the same destination (Altlanta comes to mind). Let them activate the device ~10 minutes before landing. Well, you got 30 planes with no communication and no navigation.
Of course pilots are trained to do an emergency landing on the nearest airport in this case, but having 30 planes without communication with the airport and only visual navigation might be interesting …
If you can take over communication with ground, you may be able to direct all 30 planes to a single point in space where they blow up in a kind of advanced firework.    ",Gruenfrosch,2006-04-25 16:19:00

Sure new policies and rules were implemented, but to tear a nation apart people need to be paranoid, they need to fear their next door neighbor. So whoever these would be terrorists are, they need to infiltrate the residential areas, the nice communities in the suburbs where all the houses are clones of each other. Now of course they can't simply buy the house and gain everyone's trust just to turn around and start attacking. They'll need to get already established people, the type that have been there for a good ten to twenty years. Now some ways to ""persuade"" them into joining are many, such as money, a new start, or threatening loved ones. They're terrorist, they'll find a way. Once they have the average Joe recruited, this new operative will either plant or wear a bomb in a public, ""safe"" location, such as a Wal-Mart or shopping mall. Them boom! But the trick here is not to keep this person's identity secret. The terrorists could have planted a note by the bomber, saying they're part of some terrorist group called Angry Homeowners of America or something, and they're taking the fight to the people. So now when the news crews go out to this person's house, which is filled with AK-47s and such, all the neighbors will say, ""I can't believe Joe would do such a thing, I would have never suspected it. We've known him for years, we had dinner once a month."" This isn't some guy from the Middle East, this is the neighbor that's been next to you for ten years, someone you consider close and a friend.

People will board themselves in their homes, keeping their children by their side. The nation stops functioning, no one wants to leave their homes for work or school.

c55259,a000808,"Plot:  The group of terrorists are out to disrupt us *economically*. The popular mode of ""24"" panning to 4 scenes at once can be utilized at various points in the movie when several things get coordinated at once. First the movie starts with my original idea, (hard to give up, I love that one.) A series of tractor-trailers, either rented, owned, or hijacked are brought onto the Freeways of Los Angeles at afternoon rush hour.  It is a coordinated effort at various choke points timed for 5PM.  All they do is jack-knife those trucks at the choke points.  Like the 405/134 interchange, the 405/605 interchange, the 605/10 interchange and the 5/405 interchange.  After the trucks are flipped over, the perpetrators simply walk away, ostensibly to a waiting lead car. End result, the majority of commerce and traffic in L.A. are disrupted for a day, causing millions in damage.  Clueless law-enforcement units recriminate themselves and point fingers.  (The sidekick and comic-relief can be inserted here, assuming the hero was introduced in the traffic tie-up as a local law enforcement officer.) The next half hour is built in plot development.  The perpetrators working on their next caper.  To damage one or several *oil refineries* in the U.S. at the same time.  Scenes from the ARCO plant near Long Beach can be used for the rest of the movie. Raison d’être:  Given the current U.S. situation, everyone is mad at the sudden increase in gasoline prices.  Much of the blame can be rested on the lack of refinery capacity.  As radio pundits are fond to claim, there hasn't been a new refinery built in the U.S. in 30 years.  A side dialogue can be used to blame environmentalists.  A sudden disruption in the gasoline flow could cause nationwide economic chaos, ala ""Atlas Shrugged"" (using gas instead of railways and copper.) (Note this situation exacerbated in just the last 10 days since your April 15th newsletter announcing the contest.  I hadn't thought of this then.) A few gratuitious scenes of potential riots at the pump should be added.  (Food riots due to failed out-of-fuel truck delivery systems too.) The remainder of the story would be the build-up to the eventual climax.    Perpetrators plotting, handing out cash, renting cars, getting in place, casing their targets, etcetera. Government counter-terrorist units should be portrayed as bumbling fools.  The perpetrator's plot should be discovered at the grass-roots cop (our hero) on the street level.  When the plot is stopped, it should be prevented by the unwashed masses.  Watchful refinery workers at the plant for example (perhaps with a hint from our hero,) notice the econo-terrorists casing the place.  They in turn, get in touch with *other* refinery workers at other plants in other parts of the country, (perhaps via family, or union connections) who notice the same thing.  (Joe guy-on-the-street feel-good time, yeah.) Of course they coordinate local-law enforcement just in the nick of time.  Depending on the Director, more gratuitous scenes of mass-violence, perhaps a lynching at the refinery of a captured perpetrator, cross-beams (maybe prevented just in the nick of time by our hero or sidekick, with a feel-good speech of the usual ""we can't become like them"" theme.

Fundamentalist pilots in the Royal Saudi Air Force (there's probably more than a few) use the cover of a training mission to fly away with two F-15 fighters and a tanker plane for mid-air refueling.  Flying low and evasively, they make their way up the Red Sea, across the Sinai, over the Mediterranean, and out into the Atlantic.  Refueling repeatedly on the long flight across the Atlantic, they approach the American coast.  Dropping below radar or using the cover of a passing commercial jet, they cross the Chesapeake Bay and head for the airspace over Washington.  Still unchallenged, they fly over downtown D.C. and attack the White House, the Capital and landmark monuments with Sidewinder missiles.  Pedestrians and traffic around the Mall are strafed with the F15's 20mm cannon.  Sparrow air-to-air missiles are used to attack commercial air traffic around National Airport or any National Guard F-15s that manage to respond to the airspace intrusion.  Finally, the two F-15s and their lumbering tanker crash into various buildings along the Mall. Fantasy?  Hopefully.  But U.S. F15s made the reverse flight during the Gulf War, refueling seven times for the 15-hour flight from Langley AFB, Virginia to Saudi Arabia.  The Saudi Air Force also has the necessary KC-130 tankers for aerial refueling.  The F15 has a 3,000 nautical miles range with conformal fuel tanks and three external fuel tanks.  The Saudi Air Force has 15 F-15D fighters configured for two pilots (one can sleep while the other flies), and 47 single-seat F-15Cs.  The F15 can be armed with a 20mm, six-barrel cannon; four Sidewinder and four Sparrow air-to-air missiles.  It's a lot of firepower to use against non-military targets.  ",E.M.,2006-04-25 21:10:00

For the film you wouldn't actually use Starbuck's but a made up company that is near the size of starbucks. They serve 300 million customers/beverages a day. It would have to be a tasteless, odorless slow releasing toxin so that the taste testers at the factory would not show immediate effects. Due to the amount of people that drink the coffee it would take a couple of days to realize that it was the coffee beans, by that time Millions would be dead or dying.

c55273,a000808,"A team of fifty terrorists kidnap the entire family of the Admissions Director at one of the most popular Universities in the United States. They force such director to open the office in the middle of the night on March 29th. All terrorists work around the clock by building extremley thick admission packets that contain a rather simple ""spraying"" device inside. This device is similar to the one used by the famous Bjork stalker of Hollywood, Florida. A cheap device, it sprays any acid of your choice into the person who opens the folder at hand. An obtainable substance such as sulfuric acid is spread into as much admission packets as possible, which, in a perfect scenario could reach 40,000. (USC, NYU, and a lot of Ivy Leage schools recieve as much applicants). On April 1st of that year, College-Bound Seniors around the 50 states and the world would find a horrible surprise in their admission packets: A disfigured face for life. 25% would die instantly. Imagine demoralizing an entire generation by applying the same method to three or more top Universities. The attack could reach about 30% of America's youth and mark them for life. Just when they expected to find the greatest news of their lives. Two weeks later, when the country's eyes are on the admission packets, suicide bombers attack 6 Universities simultaneously in different parts of the country. The effects of such a terror attack could be greater than you may think. Universities would lose enrolling students that year to the extent that they would report significant losses in tuiton incomes. Many private schools would go bankrupt....even a Harvard. Universities would also lose future applicants who do not want to take a risk in the years after the attack. Thousands of students would be displaced, overflowing non-damaged universities. Thousands would lose their degrees.  And you know what? A country with no education could lose everything. The effects could echo on American society decades after such a simple attack. What a scary thought. ",Andres Anton,2006-04-25 23:37:00
c55278,a000808,"I think that it would be more effective to turn people paranoid than to do a huge attack, that would bring them together, paranoia works best in my oppinion. 
plan 1: Inflitrate communities, schools (as teachers and such) and most importantly, the government. They should act like really nice people, make sure they have clean criminal records, gain people's confidence and all that. after a year or so, start planting bombs in their houses that are set to blow up all in the same day. The teachers should work on brainwashing the children about how evil america is by invading Iraq et all. The ones infiltrated in the government should work on making sure that the other members dont get kicked out of the country, and also make some corruption scandals here and there to lower the govermnent's credbility. Bombs blow up! but there's no way of knowing why those people were targeted, therefore crating a lot of paranoia. this would work best if done in  small towns, not big cities, therefore they will start feeling that not even in a small city people are safe. just for the hell of it, do the same plan on a big city or two, just to increase the fear. the terrorists should try to incriminate another neighboor(s) with planting the bombs, that would create distrust between members of a comunity or neighboorhood.  compliment for plan 1: terrorists should go to food factories for canned food (in unstable times, people consider caned food the safest) and poison the fod before it is canned, therefore there would be no way for anyone to know which cans are poisioned or not, since there would be no markings on the cans to give it away. do this with many different food companies, therefore people won't know where to turn for food. of course poison normal food too, cyanide in bottles of coke, etc. and poison some town's water supplies. Also, poison the food in restaurants with a quick poison (cyanide) so some customers will drop dead while at the restaurant, making people go less and less to restaurants. people will rarely leave home in this conditions and won't trust anyone. to end things with a bang (and since this terrorists wants to die for their cause to go to heaven to be with 72 virgins and all that), the terrorists should get some weapons and strap thenselves with bombs, and go to public places (malls, parks, public gatherings, concerts, etc) and start shooting people, as many as possible, then when the police gets there, blow yourself up, taking as many cops with you as possible. before doing that, remember the brainwashed children? by this time they should be pretty brainwashed, so the teachers should tell me to go on killing sprees at their schools (oh, the teachers should have put the ""anarchists cookbook"" as mandatory reading so they can learn a trick or two about mayhem) or they could just cause mayhem and all that (since their are so brainwashed, they dont mind dying, they will be meet by 72 virgins after all!) this should be done with 10 -12 year olds, in schools in bad neighborhoods,they probably wouldn't mind wrecking some havoc themselves. so the adults will be scared of the children, people will be scared of going anywhere or eating, since food (even canned goods!) has been found poisioned, and people will be afraid of drinking water since the water reserves have been poisioned. TOTAL fear!!
as a bonus, the terrorists should leave some plans and such of ""future"" attacks just to freak people out some more, and also to throw them off the scent, for example leave plans about bombing a bridge in a a big city or a landmark, then, since a lot of police and security will be sent to those areas to protect them, other parts of those cities or of the country will be left unprotected, leaving them open for a large scale attack 9/11 style! (can you say dirty bomb?)  for each city, put around 2-3 terrorists living there, infiltrating the communities, one as a teacher, one working on a food factory and one working for something govermnent related. their should behave and not give any hints that they might be up to something. they should be model citizens, maybe even have a girlfriend to make themselves look less suspicious.",Celbertin,2006-04-26 00:50:00

c55286,a000808,"Terrorists infilitrate a Pakistani Airliner headed for the United States via Europe.  The passengers themselves are harmless -- except for one man.  He is clearly of Middle-Eastern/Pakistani appearance, but is dressed as a business man; much older and more distinguished than the prototypical terrorist. Amongst his ""Western business man"" possessions is a cellular phone, not unlike the other passengers aboard this airplane.  But this phone, unlike the others, is linked to a low-yield nuclear bomb hidden away in the plane's cargo hold... The bomb itself was ""smuggled"" aboard by al-Queda operatives under the aegis of Pakistan's ISI intelligence force.  Months prior to this operation, the ISI had trained and supported select al-Queda jihadists to work as airline luggage employees.  After successful training, the ISI helped to plant the men at the airport flying out of Islamabad.  These men played their parts as luggage handlers with impeccable skill. The nuclear weapon was also provided to the operatives by the ISI, in disassembled parts.  The parts were re-assembled under the supervision of Pakistani nuclear weapons scientists.  Once completed, the bomb was ""disguised"" -- its outer shell was removed and it was buried within several lead-encased boxes.  These boxes were then painted/covered over with a wood grain finish.  Some of these boxes were actually packed with clothes, personal items, etc. -- anything needed to add to the legitimacy of the cargo.  Finally, the ""hot item"" was loaded into the airliner; it avoided x-ray detection through the efforts of the inside men working within the airport. When the plane reaches Europe, the lone operative aboard (the business man), makes a seemingly innocuous phone call.  But the dismal reality is this phone call arms the bomb through a frequency in the business man's cell phone.  The modified phone sends a signal directly to a receiving mechanism on the bomb itself. That receiving mechanism is a barometer-based gauge.  Once the plane descends into US airspace, the barometer is triggered and engages the short-fuse timer.  Moments thereafter, the bomb explodes as the plane makes its final descent. Because the plane's altitude is still relatively high and its course steady, the US rapid-response air defenses fail to see the threat coming.  No F-16s are sent to intercept, and no air-traffic control warnings are issued to the plane. The plane's in-bound status from Europe also aids the terrorists; if the plane were on a direct Pakistan-to-US flight, then a greater level of scrutiny would have been placed upon it by the United States. Finally, because the plane's altitude is still relatively high, the resulting nuclear detonation is far more devastating because the bomb has enough height to clear any potential buildings that might othewise mitigate its blast, however nominal that may be.",God Hands,2006-04-26 02:19:00
c55289,a000808,"Mass poisoning with LSD is interesting.
1) Preparing a lot of LSD isn't necessarily easy. Competent chemistry students or amateurs are readily available, but  where do you find a lot of raw ergot? Maybe te terrorist would need a farm to grow it.
2) Mass distribution to a whole city can be low tech: just pour the product into wells (to saturate a water table of modest size) or into basins and rivers.
3) Not everyone drinks tap water: start large fires as part of other large attacks and bystanders will breathe sprayed poisoned water from fire hoses.
4) Quantity and timing are critical: the attacks needs to alter a lot of people at the same time, any small group has enough backup and oversight to avoid serious impairment and accidents.

c55300,a000808,"The Plot is simple and cheap: Assume you have 20-30 men, willing to die, and that they are in US already. Buy a few machine guns and lots of ammo. Split them up in teams of two persons each to start with, and each team pick a relatively small town each in each their own state. 
They drive there and go on a massive killing spree down the main street for lets say 2 hours and then move on to the next town, which has to be minimum a 3 hour drive away. If one of the persons gets killed, the oother will continue the mission alone.
None of the killer-pairs communicate with each other, they pick the next city after 'finishing' the previous city, so no overall plan is available. The next town can easily be in another state. No rules!   This should make it possible to hit quite a lot of cities before getting 'stopped', making people panic in the 'countryside' and get US on its knees.

c55340,a000808,"Terror Plot Movie Contest: Molly was born when her step-father, Hank, made her older sister, Lilly,                                                                                                                                                               pregnant. When Molly learned of this, at a young age, the stigma and guilt always followed as she matured within an immature backwood red state town, a place where conferate flags still flew and where Klan grandfathers were idolized and worshipped.  Anti-homo and big-hipped Hillary jokes as popular as the Bud in the only bar miles around.  Her husband's picture adorned the dartboard where knives and ice picks were thrown instead of darts. Always cowering before these stubbornhicked hardnosed bubbahs and now doing the bidding of Uncle Hank, all Molly wanted to do was please everyone she met.  You see, it was all she could do.  It was all everyone wanted her to do. At the young, tender age of 13, Molly-- weak from a whippin' by Hank's brother,  Uncle Ned--hooked up with her best friend, BettySue, who knew someone with a truck and would drive them out of town. With not many places to go in these parts they got dropped off at the truck stop located on the state road, next town over. Here they easily met a a couple of long-haulers, Virgil and Mitt.  And an exciting evening of twilight sex had all of them, Molly with Virgil and BettyLou with Mitt. Sure they'd never done anything like this before, but what did they care--they waz just wantin' to meet and be with someone new--it wasn't like they never did anything that hadn't already been done to them before. After the sex romp, Virgil and Mitt bought a hearty home-styled dinner for the two young women.  Molly found herself sittin' next to Mitt, the trucker who'd just been hammering her friend.  He kept fondling her under the table and couldn't stop whispering in her ear. All Molly could do was eat, smile and listen.  For Molly's world this was better than it had ever had been. Dinner was done, the moon was full and fate moved heavy as Molly, almost automatically, found herself waving bye-bye to BettyLou, Molly had fixed her mind that she was gonna be Mitt's traveling squeeze. And he had told her during dinner that  she was gonna see all of America!  Molly was new! While the big rig, already thundered-up,  heaved and weaved out from the walls other rigs, Molly thought: ""Lordy--(she knew some 'bout religion; but not much)--I'll never ever see that BettyLou again!"" But her next thought struck her like a joyful bolt of lightning:  No more of that Crawdaddy Hank, no more of that nasty Uncle Ned and no more of that stupid silly Lilly--no more of the horrid place Molly once called home--she was leaving the house where she'd been born forever--whatever that meant! ""Yippie"" she squeeled against the sound of the truck's wheels, peeping through her sided rear-view mirror and watching the truck stop and her last image of Betty Lou disappear more and more. The large-framed mirror also caused her to see the mirror of her own eyes.  It was a nice glimpse into herself. Molly was leaving pretty! Next, she snookered hip-to-hip close to the now very-happy but concentrating trucker.  Placing her arms over Mitt's plaid-shirted shoulders, she whispered sweetly into his passenger-side ear, ""thanks, Mitt."" With a kiss she Molly gone! Over the next five years, Mitt long gone, she bounced from one trucker to the next handsomest one; or sometimes just being with the one who treated her the nicest.  And many were the fistfights and broken beer bottles she'd left behind as they all wanted to duke it out to get her. Even though all she was conditioned, all she ever wanted to do was please, it was hard to keep Molly. Everyone loved Molly!  Everyone wanted Molly. By the time she'd hit the age 18 she knew every truck stop and almost every trucker in America, always refusing to go to a truck stop near to where she was born.  Heck, she'd just pick up another trucker rather than go that route--and she met all kinds of people along the way. Everyone wanted Molly. On a cloudy day, somewhere on the outskirts of of Akron, Ohio, Molly met her first mobster, Nick The Flick.  Nick was there to negotiate a deal with Ernie--the trucker who'd been buying Molly's meals, paying for flea-bagged motels and banging her hard--to haul  some heavy drugsk coast to coast. Nick, by his darting and quivering eyes  and the way his hands furiously moved, obviously took an instant hankering to Molly.  He couldn't stop looking at her, up and down, as he instructed Ernie on what had to happen for the deal to happen. When it ended, without any say at all in the matter, Molly suddenly realized she'd become part of the deal. Now she's Nick's. They drove away olden, well-maintained and highly-polished black cadellac--this was very different to the big rigs she long had been used to being in. The Flick tried his best to make her feel comfortable with him.  He was older, different than anyone she'd ever been with before.  She knew this, but it didn't matter much after he bought her all kinds of fancy stuff, including clothes she'd never seen before and  ones much nicer than the simple cutoffs, skimpy haltertops and plaid shirts she was accustomed to. After all Molly'd been through before, she was only mildly astonished to discover that she was about to become the new and featured stripper at Flicks, Nick's two-bit strip joint on the edges of Cincinnati. Nick promised her she'd become an instant hit in his club, she'd be his best act--and that everyone would love her! And so it happened. Briefly into her new, first and only career ever, Molly began receiving something she'd never had before:  legitimate attention for something that she controlled.  It was different than just a man controlling her body. Nick was right.  Everybody who saw her loved her!  She even got to know some of bible-thumping preachers and distant city politicans who'd sometimes come in and start out by sitting in the back rows.  But by the end of her dance routine, they were as close to Molly as could possibly be. This happened night after night.  Over and over, her hair long and flowing, beautiful and always in a new change of brilliant coloring,  Molly showered her extremely lithe body, her almond joy, her breasts perky with protrusion hard as could be at the two most important  points--on everyone. She was as well-built of a woman as well-built woman could be.  The whistles and catcalls she got were as deafening as any heard anywhere.  It was almost like an entirely new sound. In between her dancing acts she'd schmooze with her fans.  She'd use her penetrating knowledge from her past, what she knew about trucks.  She gave  Peterbilt and Kenworth new meaning Her sure southern-style and sweetsong voice were siren lures.  When she walked, no one talked; when she winked, hearts would sink; when she smiled the room went wild. Molly finally found a home! She enjoyed making most men--if not all men (remember the preachers?)--melt too deeply in their own pants.  Finally, she had some power and control. Still, however, Molly was not in complete control.  She'd really only become a precious commodity, a value to anyone able to control her. So you can imagine Molly's near disappointment when, after finally doing so well, somewhat on her own, that she learned Nick The Flick had given her to someone else in exchange for part interest in some condos in Florida. Enter into Molly's life Chicago mob boss, Domi The Dommino.  Molly was his next.  Dealing with mobsters, there was nothing she could do  but go with the flow. She was thinking stripping for mobsters was better than being a truck whore for roughians; and that being a truck whore for roughians was better than living with the kind of family that inbred her.  She knew all of this too well. As usual, The Dommino wouldn't do the deal with The Flick unless he got Molly in the deal.  He did. Surprisingly, the dark olive-skinned, dapper and somewhat whimsical gangster sweetened Molly's pie when he told her he'd treat her right, that he could help to change her life for the better and he promised her that she'd make lotsa money.   He even assured her he'd get her some education--Molly's weak point. Of all the promises, all but the last one she'd heard before in varying ways.  It was the education part that appealed mostly. Although she'd been all over America and met so many different kinds of people, she never ever thought of herself as anything but a road smart but still someone else's dumb babe. For sure she knew how to charm a man, even a trucker or a preacher; she knew how clever to become, or just what to do in order get by in bed; and she knew she how to look absolutely stunning, with or without clothing, while dancing on dim-lit and eye-lit, smoked-filled strip stage.  Lately, that's all there was. And then there was the always continuous string of sad, never joyful very bad memories.    Which is probably why she never became a heavy drinker, her sorrows were too thick to even think of when drunk. So Molly saw her next fading image.  It was Nick The Flick. There he hung at the end, wearing one of many sharkskin suits, smoking any one of  many different Cuban cigars and leaning with a kept confidence, his shoulder on the side his club entrance.  His face flushed funny in glimmering of sthe bright flash bulbed lights where the marquee read, ""Now Dancing--Good Golly Miss Molly, her stage name. When driving away, as she peered out the window, she first thought that Nick was tipping his hat to her.  She then thought better of it, for she knew Nick would only tip his hat toward The Dominno.  She knew if it were she to whom he was bidding adieu, he'd at least blow a kiss in her direction.  He didn't.  He got condos! So now Nick's gone, no more dancing at The Flick--it'll be different all over again. As usual, her thoughts skipped to the bright side.  Although she only went from one mobster to another, at least this time she had a better sense as to what would come. She'd given up bubbah's pickup truck; she'd given up the big rigs; and today she'd given up the polished caddy. Molly was now being chauferred in a long, sleek and plush white, not black limo.  And the man next to her was high end.  She wasn't just gonna now pass through Chicago, she was gonna become the heartthrough of the city.  She thought about her own heart, but didn't have time. You see, everyone loves Molly--and now The Dommino has her. It was a long drive to Chicago.  All the way, she fondled and got fondled by her new control, Domi, who in between his graspy feels he filled her head with dreams of what a great stripper she was about to become, what Chicago would be like, who she'd meet and what she could do living in a such a large and important city. As they eventually closed in on the city, he talked about Chicago's blues clubs.  Her ears perked and her body shimmered.  She had only recently  learned about the blues and black people. Molly was sick of country music.  She hated it, what with the many truckers in her life.  While in Cincinatti she'd gotten deep into rocknroll and disco, especially while dancing at The Flick.  But blues music was new to her and she wanted to experience it fully. As they entered the city she put her complete past even further behind her. After settling into a nice penthouse, she discovered Chicago was perfect, all it could be.  Her stripper friends were prettier, more intelligent and it seemed like they knew better ways to do everything.  But, more importantly, they liked her too and for the first time in her life, really since BettyLou, she made some friends.  Real friends. Again, everyone liked Molly! Domi, true to his word about education, set Molly up with a recently divorced college professor.  Bertran was a microbiologist from the University of Chicago, who'd frequently visit many of Domi's clubs where Molly had become almost the top-billed, if not the top-billed dancer. Bertran would follow her from club to club and always, because of Domi's purposeful introduction, got time with her where he'd teach her something new, something of educational value.  And, of course, he'd get a little (not much) in return.  But they became very good friends. The next year was a good for Molly--really, the best year in her life.  The only downside was that she got to know Domi more and began observing some of the dark side.  But, as always, she was excellent at looking the other way,  She ignored that part. And even that became moot when one day Domi told her he was setting her up on a national tour, that she'd be dancing at the very best, the most prestigious, strip clubs all throughout America's best cities. She was promised lots of money, something she never really, until recently, had much of.  Nor did she have much need of money since the person who controlled her always provided what was needed. Domi was married and had a family, so they were only part-time lovers. Molly actually had some freedom in Chicago and her blues were now the good blues, the musical blues, not the bad ones.  She and her stripper friends hit all the clubs and were welcomed as special guests everywhere they went. Molly's table had finally been set. When the tour happened Molly found herself jet-setting from club to club, from Boston and New York to Miami and Atlanta to Houston and Dallas and LA and Vegas.  And most everywhere she went her nationally-renowed friend Bertran kept connecting her with professerial types who'd always wanna trade her learnin' for their yearnin'.  Sometimes even Bertran would show up. Molly actually had became intelligent.  By now, she knew how to get anything she wanted, wherever she wanted and when she wanted it.  And Domi too, when he could get away, would also visit her and whatever city they'd be in would be theirs. Everybody loved Molly and Molly was conditioned to please.  She did. But fate took yet another twist when Domi, while the two were vacationing and gambling in San Juan, fell ill after a heavy bout of sex.  She learned  the next day he had died due to heart complications.  She was heartbroken. Domi's funeral was not easy for Molly, as his wife and his entire family were present.  She pretty much stayed in the background throughout the arrangements. It was here she met a tall, handsome Arab-accented man.  Husam was a world traveler and he knew as much about the whole world as she knew about all of America. For the first time in her life she was free--there was no one to control or need for anyone to provide for her.  She could actually begin making her own decisions. After the funeral Molly returned to her penthouse in Vegas.  She wasn't dancing anymore, she'd already done an occassional porn scene here and there, but didn't like the people involved in that industry and, beautiful as she was,  she had become too marked for Hollywood. All she had was her beauty and lotsa  money, money that she'd made being a famous dancer and even more money that Domi had left her--she was in his will. From bubbahs to truckers to mobsters; from preachers to politicians to judges, academics and CEOs of the major and minor corporations--Molly knew every kind of American there was.  And even with all of this, for the first time in her life, she became bored.  Very bored.  Didn't gave a clue what to do next. This got solved one sunny day when her telephone rang.  It was Husam.  He wanted her to travel with him and visit several European countries.  She did and they in the best hotels, dined at the finest restaurants and danced in the best clubs possible.  He became her lover ... her international lover! It seemed like everywhere she went all she found were adoring people who absolutely revered and loved Husam. Molly, for the first time in her life, was finally happy doing what she wanted to do and not what someone else wanted her to do.  But even so still she was  conditioned to please people, especially men.  ",PartyTime,2006-04-26 10:47:00
c55346,a000808,"Well, I have to participate in this one. :) It's basically related to the Anthrax scare and what happened afterwards, mainly with people flooding calls for anything that *might* have been related to anthrax. I would go with the cell structure, small groups working together. You only need 1-2 people in a group and the best way to handle it is to spread it out as far as possible. Get something airborn and poisonous. Anthrax, various poisons, it doesn't matter. The main part is to make sure it has some easily mistaken form, to encourage people to call on other suspcious stuff. Then, have someone with a big bag of of it (or cut with flour or something), run through a mall and drop it to it explodes. People will get sick, obviously, but that just sets the stage. Do it again in another mall or crowded indoor space (contained environments are easier to poison). When the news starts to die down, do it again in a different part of town. Keep doing this as long as you have supplies. One important part is the random locations. The less predictable it is, the more people will panic and generally start seeing *everything* in crowded places as potential poisons. You can screw with people's heads (increasing panic) by just using flour (because it blossoms nicely). In a very crowded mall, say a couple days before Christmas, that would almost ensure a riot. I would focus on malls for a couple of reasons. The primary is that it is a contained space. Much of this country's focus is on shopping, so the panic will drive people away from commerce centers. If the attacks are persistent and unknown, it will build up an irrational fear of shopping. Leaving bags of twenties in random places, with flour also helps keep up the fear. Making sure that half of them are poisonous lets you get away with more. Once you establish that, then you start expanding it out, dropping flour or powder poisons from the edges of buildings during holidays or working hours, in the trains. Once people start associating that with being violently sick, it is almost guarenteed to cause riots and chaos. And every time it happens, it will increase the odds of incident calls, such as people who see perfectly harmless stuff on the ground, in their house, or outside. That increases the number of false positives (which is why you need real onces in there).",t'Sade,2006-04-26 11:18:00

They also steal a few bombs. Meanwhile, in Washington D.C. a group of ten terrorists, who have been living in the u.s. for years, have managed to gather information on five strategic places around the vecinity of Pennsilvania Avenue. They have the exact addresses, information on who lives, works, etc. on four apartments and one office in that area. The stolen weapons(rocket launchers with the missiles, and the bombs) arrive in the U.S. hidden in a cargo ship. The terrorist transport them in a truck made up to look like a UPS or a FEDEX truck. They get the weapons into Washington D.C. The day of the attack? The day of the President's Inauguration. Early that day, the terrorists, riding in the UPS truck, enter each of the apartments and the one office they had staked out. It appears as if they are simply delivering packages. They kill the people in the apartments and one office, and get the rocket launchers inside. The apartments and office are all within 1/2 a mile of each other, all overlooking Pennssilvania Avenue. There are two terrorists per apartment and the one office.

All of them in the same direction, aimed at the president, the dignataries, the congressmen, the guests, the ex-president and anyone in attendance at the ceremony. They are some distance away, but with the traveling capability of the missiles, they hit multiple targets.

Striking Fear into the hearts of everyone.

The key to success here--the terrorists themselves are willing to die.     Take your 20 to 30 unskilled people, infect them a highly contagous and potentially fatal airborne illness like TB (or something even more sinister, but in a real life scenario, TB will do--see this link  (http://www.pulmonologychannel.com/tuberculosis) for basic info about TB. Send your 30 human time-bombs into a major metropolitan area--Washington DC and NYC--and have them ride the subway, go to museums, visit transportation hubs like Grand Central Station and Union Station, go to the food courts and  dining establisments, visit major tourist destinations: like the empire state building elevators, go to the movies, ride busses and the like.  Before long, a minor outbreak can potentially become an epidemic. Would it be possible to contain such a concentrated, coordinated effort? Once they hit a major city, they all board planes to spread out around the country. The irony of putting infected terrorists onto airplanes would make for a most dramatic scene in the film. The scenario in which a terrorist is profiled, taken aside for a full body search, only to be cleared to board an airplane would be dramatic and tragic.  Since the person is the ""bomb""--the threat is in the very air the are breathing. As a movie, the plot may end up being a cross between Outbreak and a season of 24--more concerned with the medical response than catching the terrorists, as they will all be dead when they succomb to the effects of the disease.   Containment would be difficult.  The spread would be subtle at first. In reality, this type of attack could inflict severe damage--creating quarantine zones, impacting hospitals and medical facilities, and creating fear.  It is the idea that you are not safe. We talk of freedom--but this type of attack would throw into the question the very idea that the air we breathe is free. This could also be the first stage of an attack--such that once the medical establishment and CDC are tied up with the TB outbreak--a second wave attack (either biological) Avian Flu or SARS or some other biological agent (remember Anthtrax?) would be unleashed, or conventional explosives and the like--directly on hospitals and such.",evil ash,2006-04-26 15:41:00

c55457,a000808,"Roddy at April 2, 2006 05:11 PM proposes pumping air into a gas pipeline to create an explosive mixture, and then igniting it. I think it would be hard to do much damage that way. First, you can't just pump air into the pipeline. You'll set off pressure alarms and blow safety valves. To go undetected for more than a few  minutes (seconds?) you'd have to remove an equal amount of gas. You could do that, but now the plumbing is more complicated. At a 10-to-1 air to gas ratio, there's not much gas left. You could do better by pumping in O2; then you only need a 2-to-1 ratio. But now you need tanks of O2, and the scale of the attack is limited by the number of tanks you can amass. I don't know about trans-continental pipelines, but the gas pipes that run under city streets are at 50 PSI, which is just over 3 atmospheres, and the pressure is downregulated to a few PSI at the gas meter before it enters a building. So there isn't that much gas in the pipes, and that limits the size of the bang. You don't get to choose the time of detonation. The gas will detonate as soon as any of it reaches a lit burner or pilot light, and that will probably happen before you've pumped very much O2 into the system. The detonation will probably propagate back through the system, although it might stop at the meter, the pressure regulator, or the thermocouple cutoff. In any case, it would be hazardous to your health to be attending the O2 injection equipment when this happens. The original post talked about a 2.5 ton (of TNT) explosion, but I think that is optimistic. And whatever explosion you do get is going to be distributed through great lengths of pipe. Most of that length is underground, so not many people will be hurt. If it ruptures pipes, safety systems will cut off the flow immediately. Even if it doesn't, the gas company is going to know that something is seriously wrong. My guess is that the best you can do with an attack like this is
- start a few fires
- cause a few injuries
- wreck some gas meters and appliances
- rupture some gas mains (as backhoe operators have always done)     One additional cost going forward might be the need to inspect equipment and appliances for damange before they can be put back into service. There could be a lot more potentially damanged equipment than actually damage equipment, and the only way to find out is to have a licensed technician go on-site to see. That could multiply the ultimate cost of the attack. Even so, I don't think this is a 9-11 class attack. It is more nusicance-level.",Steven McDougall,2006-04-26 23:19:00

A weekend of drunken debauchery, fornication, and drug use promises the most bang for the buck -- for party people and terrorists alike. The storyline pitches both sides against each other. In one corner, stand idealistic extremists who seek enlightenment through martyrdom. In the other corner, sit hedonists who find enlightenment and pleasure through sexual gratification and mind altering substances. Both groups ultimately have the same goals.  Whether in this life or the after-life, both groups seek bliss. And ultimately, neither path is justified. ",MarcVig,2006-04-27 10:40:00
c55560,a000808,"Now We Know Our A,B,C’s. Terrorists attack the most vulnerable targets – school children. Day 1:  Teams of two or three people hit (bombs or snipers – a mixed bag is best) several school bus stops in a few cities (at least one large city, a small city, and a wealthy suburb) beginning with the letter A.  Attacks continue for the next several days, but not everyday, until media coverage has created a satisfying level of panic. Day 10: Teams move to cities beginning with the letter B. Repeat pattern. Day 17: Teams move to cities beginning with the letter C. Day 22: Teams move to cities with the letter D.  By now, the media have picked up on the pattern, so that people begin to anticipate the attacks in cities next in the alphabet. Particularly because it is children, people will overreact.  Small times in the perceived threat range may shut down entirely.  Many schools will also shut down in response.  School schedules will be disrupted, parent’s lives and the businesses that they work for will be in disarray. Day 24: Teams move to cities with the letter E. Day 27:  Attacks cease.  Almost three weeks go by, allowing terror and anticipatory dread to invade lives, as well as “security measures��? to be implemented.  (Focus will be on security theater for the media circus) Modus operandi reviewed and revised to take into account these “security measures.��? Day 45:  Attacks resume, targeting on “F��? cities, with priority given to circumventing security measures of “high profile��? cities, i.e. those whose officials had good media coverage.  When successful, this makes people feel that there is nothing that can be done.  City officials respond with more theater, and some draconian measures. Day 51:  Terrorists shift targets from bus stops to parks and playgrounds for “G��? cities. The terror continues, with specific types of attacks and target locations varying, as well as timing.  The only constants are that the targets are always school children, and the inexorable march to the end of the alphabet. By the end of the movie, draconian measures have been taken so that no child ever ventures out of doors anymore.

Those satellites, known as Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites, can detect the infrared energy radiated from the hot exhaust of a missile's rocket engine launched from anywhere on the earth's surface. In 1979, the system indicated a massive Soviet nuclear strike. The entire continental air defense interceptor force was put on alert, and at least 10 fighters took off. Furthermore, the National Emergency Airborne Command Post, the president's ""doomsday plane,"" was also launched, but without the president on board. It was later determined that a realistic training tape had been inadvertently inserted into the computer running the nation's early-warning programs. See http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/missileers/falsealarms.html In this plot, terrorists construct infrared ""bombs"" made from thermite http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermite with the aim of creating false nuclear launch alarms in the DSP system.

supports the States and deploys its troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, so
I believe we might merit some attention of the terrorist organisations (although I hope we shouldn't be very high on their wish list). I'm sending you a few pictures of a tunnel which is in the very centre of
the capital city and it's usually very busy during the daytime. As you see from the pictures, a complex of office and apartments is being build over the tunnel. And this building that's on the right side of the photograph is the Parliament building of my country so the tunnel literally goes next to one of the most important buildings in the
country. There is a road sign which prohibits transport with dangerous
loads in the tunnel (such as gasoline trucks, etc.). Now my scenario
is simple - as it would be very difficult to sneak in the huge amount
of explosives or obtain them in our country, I assume, the terrorists
might highjack a few gasoline truck, drive them into the tunnel during
the busiest hour and explode them. I believe that would take the risk
of breaching the traffic sign prohibiting dangerous loads in this

Recreate basic events of 9/11 - a small group trains for a specialized task to carry out four coordinated attacks.  The bad guys boast of the recreating the successes of 9/11 using the same model. The groups trains for and infiltrates the merchant marine (nationality is unimportant).  Points of attack are the Malacca Straits (as described in Dangerous Waters by John Burnett); the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP)/Port Fourchon; the Panama Canal; and the Suez Canal. It's only necessary to land one or two entry level crew members per ship over the period of a year.  Just as with 9/11, wait for the right environment (all the ships in the right spots at the same time), then execute.  The goal is to severely damage the targets.  One ship would need to be an oil tanker making a port of call at LOOP.  Big explosions aren't required for purposes of the plot.  Realize that a one-degree heading error, by the time it is discovered, will be too late to correct before a collision occurs.  No massive takeovers are required.  While not required for the plot, to make the idea more saleable to Hollywood, the Panama/Suez Canal attacks could spectacularly destroy a ship in the locks. By knocking out a major US oil port and disrupting international shipping lanes, gasoline goes to $10-$15 per gallon in the US, the economy grinds to a halt, there are mass layoffs and mass shortages not just of oil but of food (no more lettuce from 3,000 miles away for Caesar Salads), and no more Nike's from Indonesia.

No way to tell for sure but it's highly likely. Then again, in which way such an unskilled group can affect the way the majority of the population perceives the situation ? Propaganda, normal for the government and huge corporations is out. Therefore what's left is probably an indirect instigation, by highly focused attacks on people of very specific groups. A group of 10 could enjoy a huge amplification in effect as soon as the affected group will strike back the wrong target. It wouldn't necessarily be a riot, but even a slow burning on the inside would impact the society. It's difficult to say which group should be targeted and it certainly depends on the country or even local situation, for example in Germany in 1920s it appeared beneficial to target jews. I'm sure special government squads were secretly raiding both sides at that time to ensure both don't return to normal. Therefore, a group with such a limited capabilities could have found a spot in which a high tension in society already presents and try to feed the fire until the tension is unbearable. The goal would then  not be to cause a riot or anything in particular, it'd be a slowly pushing people in the right direction. It'd take a lot of very careful thought, a lot of time and the outcome is not predictable at all, but this is exactly the point - the dinosaurs were not killed by the stone falling from the sky, but by the slow climate changes that came after. And it also appears that right now people are not ready to resist such an attack. Living in a world of lies, propaganda and advertisement, they would rather fight very specific particular threats rather than subtle changes in the wind. More likely not only they wouldn't notice it until it's too late, but they would try not to notice.",Dmitry Dvoinikov,2006-04-30 04:25:00
c56000,a000808,"The terrorists are split into 5 groups of 4 each.  A mother, a father, and two children.  Each group travels around the country dumping a variety of bio-contaminants into local water supplies.  The contaminants are contained in swim floats: rafts that are weighted enough to settle at the bottom of reservoir where they will be almost impossible to discover.  The fuse is a substance put into the air filler tube of each raft.  The substance dissolves at the rate of about an eighth of an inch per day.  The rafts are set to go off from two to three weeks after they have been deployed.  Over a week's time each group hits 30 water supplies. The bio-contaminants were obtained from a mothballed military facility where security had been out-sourced to a foreign company.  In general, the security and accounting at the facility have gotten so bad due to budget cuts that the stolen items would not be missed for years, if at all. If the terrorists are stopped they look like a family going to the beach that mistook the reservoir for a public lake. After all of the reservoirs are infected.  Each group loads up their mini-vans with 60 gallons of gasoline.  This is done through the regular filler cap which has been re-routed to a gas hot water heater sitting in the trunk area of the mini-van.  The fuse is put together from pieces of various fireworks that were legally purchased in states like Indiana.  The terrorists are careful to take no more that 15 gallons from each gas station that they visit and to use cash so that no credit card alerts are raised. Their targets are Boys Town, The Mayo Clinic, a Catholic Cathedral, a large Christian fundamentalist church, and a synagogue.  These are bonuses.  The real reason for the bombings are to insure that the terrorists cannot be captured and coerced into revealing which reservoirs have been poisoned.",BobO,2006-04-30 06:12:00
c56010,a000808,"A possible plot line - A small team of people collects the mold that has been allowed to fester in the areas that were hit by the hurricanes, such as New Orleans.  (While areas that were hit by tsunamis across the globe have reported serious mold problems, the US still remains optimistic and quiet about the possible mold infestations.) If one of the people could work for the US Treasury, he or she would have the opportunity to contaminate various forms of currency.  Mucormycosis would affect some people, more probably children, elderly, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems. If random forms of currency are ""attacked,"" it would take longer to locate the source of infection.  Over time, this would weaken the economy as many people are not able to convert to debit and credit cards and many businesses only accept cash. After that attack, the mold could be placed in recycled paper products.  If it is not placed in one specific product such as paper towels, it becomes much harder to trace.",Dramouflage,2006-04-30 07:25:00

c56062,a000808,"Basic Premise::
“Cheap and cheerful ‘Real-World’ technology attack on The West by a State-sponsored group��?. Would make a great movie!  SCENARIO GOAL:: 
Simultaneous “decapitation��?, and “inflammation��? attacks on two sides
of the Atlantic.   BASIS: A host ship - something like a decent sized container vessel, is either
chartered, stolen, or hijacked by Muslim-fundamentalist terrorists – state
sponsored by Iran [to the stipulated $500,000USD]. This is sailed through the
Irish Sea, slightly inland toward the western part of Britain. There would be
a series of rib boats launched from this mother ship, each crewed, and each
has some form of missiles attached – and/or a number of individuals with
RPG’s. These rib boats are heading towards Morecambe Bay in Cumbria heading
for the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing site. All terrorists on the ribs would
be armed with their own individual suicide-vest, and the rib-boats themselves
would also be packed with some C4 and collision detonators – as well as
multiple-redundant timing devices.           The large container mother ship itself would then be used for its secondary
purpose: An aircraft carrier.  Onboard, are pre-assembled large-scale model aircraft: Their airframe
manufactured not of plastic or polycarbonate - but of hardended RDX high
explosive and magnesium. 
These airframes are internally guided by their own individual GPS-powered
guidance computer; are nitro-powered and are of relatively “useful��? weight
(commonly around 15Kg - upwards). They are powerful enough to also carry a
respectable payload of HE or shaped charge, multiple detonators and/or a
compressed canister of an oil-based aerosolized chemical weapon.
Though each is not significantly powerful on its own - the amount of hardended
RDX which makes up each airframes rigid structures is only in the tens of
kilos in weight; however, these airframes cannot be tracked by radar: They are
much too small, have a tiny-radar cross section and are not fast enough to
register.
The plan would call for the simultaneous use of a multiple-wave attack using a
significant number of drones to impact on an exact impact-point basis.
These aircraft would be based on a design of a commercially produced
large-scale model, preferably available as a kit form, and would be
re-manufactured from copied components of the original kit, but in hardended
RDX instead of the original material. This remanufacturing would take place on
a small-scale industrial production process in order to develop a low-cost
finalized ""product"" that appears to be a commercial kit-form model aircraft if
inspected by Customs. 
Once repacked for export, these are then ""sold"" as commercial hobbyist
model-kits, and easily imported to the desired countries. Of course, on
arrival they are simply reassembled from their component parts at the
warehouse they are shipped to, and with all separate components to produce the
desired number of airframes. They are then mated with their specific two
detonator combo's (from a mix of timed, GPS and impact) and their guidance
computer is programmed from a flight-plan accurately plotted from Google
Earth’s co-ordinates so that aerial elevation of buildings and obstacles can
be accurately mapped out.                               They are fuelled on the day before use, and tested to ensure that they are
functional. 
They are deployed by teams of two operators from minivans, and launched from
compacted grass airstrips such as golf-courses, nursing-home grounds, museum
open spaces, sports-tracks, or obviously: tarmac roads. Their total payload
is: ""explosive airframe + shaped charge HE"" , though others can be composed
of: ""explosive airframe + pressurised aerosol chemical weapon delivery"".       The copying and re-manufacture of the airframe would take place in a strict
regime-controlled modern country such as Iran, Syria or Pakistan. This
re-manufacturing would entail the airframe components being copied, and
produced in hardened hardended RDX.     The nuclear-site targeting would need something with a much larger warhead,
and preferably using a higher velocity vehicle to impart more kinetic energy
into the target building, driving the initial impact warhead deeper into the
physical structure. Hence, the RPG’s or some form of larger missile would be
needed as an initial attack on the nuclear site. 
The idea is that the rib launches missiles at the Sellafield site, causing a
breach and the large-scale model aircraft are launched in multiple waves to
impact at exactly the same point and inflict more damage resulting in a
nuclear leakage. When HM Royal Navy come in to apprehend the terrorist in the
ribs, all the terrorists jump overboard and leave the rib to be a floating
mine. If anyone comes close to the terrorist – they self-destruct.           Simultaneously, whilst this attack is occurring, there are more GPS-guided
aircraft autonomously guided to various parts of London, and Washington DC.
They are launched from specific areas in London / Washington – always
ensuring that there is redundancy built in. One wave of drones are
pre-programmed to fly into 1 Canada Square, Canary Wharf and self-destruct on
a medial floor. 
One wave of attack is programmed to fly into 11 Downing Street – the home of
the PM, and cause significant damage. 
Further waves of attack are intended for: MI6’s Vauxhall Cross building,
around the mid-atrium, MI5’s Century House, Whitehall, the City, Oxford
Street (high population would be targeted by the oil-based aerosolized CW;
other ancillary targets: London’s Metropolitan Police headquarters, Stirling
Lines, NSA listening stations such as Menwith Hill.
The interesting bit, is that whilst one or two might go astray – fly into a
crane or something, most will hit their intended target and self-destruct
causing widespread damage and chaos. The next portion is the damage-inflicting
part: There is an immediate follow-up attack after this first “wave��? of
the initial airframe which comprises of the another series of individual
drones, all targeted at the same site and incoming with only a minute or less
apart from the first impact. This would allow the second wave to penetrate
deeper into the buildings targeted – and with proximity or pressure-sensors
to allow them to detonate on impact once they have penetrated the next layer
in on the target building. That way, people inside would have little chance to
re-organise or recover from the first impact – the second is the one which
causes the maximal damage because it has breeched the first line of defense:
Physical protection.                           The totality of the scheme only become apparent at the next stage – where a
third wave of autonomous-guided explosive aircraft arrive and impact on the
same targets as the previous two waves, less than two minutes after the
previous attack. In all likelihood, recovery would just about be starting to
be initiated, and whilst people are being evacuated – rescue personnel are
just arriving. These targets would be impacted greatly to cause significant
damage. Perhaps since the first two waves of guided drone-bombs would have
created such impact, then the third would be able to penetrate deeper into the
building, perhaps providing enough energy to cause a serious amount of damage
to the entire structure and inflicting severe casualties.          In Washington DC, the initial target would obviously be The White House –
and particularly the Oval Office, but such an attack would only take place
when The President’s itinerary would be publicly known. Again, multiple-wave
attacks would take place; most-likely with only a ten second separation of the
aircraft. Again, the only defensive option would be for marksmen to hit a
relatively fast moving (70mph), small aspect target. This multiple-wave attack
would allow for significant penetration of The White Houses hardened façade,
and would incur great damage.        Other multiple targets would include CIA Headquarters in Langley, Virginia;
NSA’s Fort Meade, and FBI’s headquarters at Quantico. Again, the ideal of
multiple-wave single-point attack would be the core to maximizing the
explosive ability of the relatively light-weight explosive autonomous
explosive devices. Other soft-targets would compose of densely packed areas,
such as New York City buildings, and such – and would most likely be the
targets for the aerosolized CF armed drones.
An external attack on some form of sea-facing US nuclear site would also be of
political use – even if it results in a minuscule release of radioactive
materiel: It’s the psychological impact that would be the fear-inducing
panic.           Has it been done? Has someone already built such devices? There are several
Open-Source projects for building such autonomous small-systems, and many are
currently in existence right now. The rate-determining-step is the payload
that can be attached to these aircraft: It is unknown just how much could be
carried by each airframe – although the airframes themselves would be
composed of hardended RDX commercial explosive and Aluminium or Magnesium
primer, manufactured into the components that make up the airframe itself –
what of the total payload? Would the payload contribute significant explosive
energy to be of useful worth?          The secondary armed  drones could contain some form of nerve-gas which could
be pressurized and opened just before launch: Thereby spraying a nerve-agent
as an aerosol throughout that aircraft's flight-path. Of course, an airframe
of this type would use some form of sticky-oil-based toxin, which would adhere
to the areas spread allowing more people to come into fatal contact with it.
As the aerosol is dispersed [not via a heavy and cumbersome pump, but by
simply pressurizing a canister with a propellant - perhaps propane or even
hydrogen, and allowing it to slowly depressurize and spray the contents as the
drone continues on its flight], the aircraft becomes lighter. So, perhaps it
still would be able to carry a “useful��? payload of explosive and it’s
explosive airframe.
Would it be possible to make the majority of the actual airframe from
pre-fabricated hardended RDX which would be hardened to be strong enough to
allow it to form the physical structure of the airframe – that way, the
weight penalty would be minimized, and the overall efficiency of the device,
maximized. 
There should be a great deal of redundancy inferred in the project: Multiple
targets are hit from multiple routes, with each airframe fitted with two of
three multiple detonators: impact, timed, and location based.                   Notes to the Atlantic Scenario:  The timing is the critical component. After all, someone standing in the way
and blatting these with a baseball bat would obviate some of the drones -
though this would result in the termination of the “blatter��? in the case
of hiting a drone which has an impact trigger.    The reality depends on how big the scale models can be; what are the current
realistic commercial sizes, and how much of a payload they can carry - and
what would be the total weight of the airframe explosive could be amassed.
Then the tricky bit is the simultaneous detonation of the internal payload of
HE and the airframe itself – can a non-concentrated explosive all be
detonated simultaneously?      Costs: Dependant on the manufacturing of the components, the hardended RDX and
the electronic hardware. On a semi-industrial scale, the re-manufacture would
be relatively miniscule, once the original base-frame kit was broken down into
its component parts and copied: Something the Asian countries are very good
at. Labor is cheap in certain parts of the world. The GPS system could be
cheap (~$200) and has been quoted in public domain projects as easily slaved
to the guidance computer / servo computer.       $500,000 could result in as many as 300 drones of the airframe type listed -
costed on the basis of buying raw parts at wholesale prices. 300 drones could
cause a significant panic and serious damage - though this does not include
any costing for a rocket-type attack on sea-facing nuclear reactors -but RPG's
are cheap and plentiful. And surely plausible that these would be donated by
the sponsor organization. By firing a multiple of RPG's at the reactor, then
launching drones from a host-ship with a large enough deck - it's own internal
GPS guidance package will take care of the rest.        The initial wave of attack-aircraft (i.e. waves one and two) should have
shaped or directional charges imparted into their front's so that they will
cause the most significant structural damage on initial impact. The third and
following waves could quite easily simply be aerosol delivery vehicles, which
explode on impact at their target when needed. This results in secondary
damage and secondary casualties.      Approximate numbers of mid-sized production could yield 100 destined for UK
and 200 destined for US.  So, beware of model-aircraft hobbyists!  POSTSCRIPT REFERENCES::

c56065,a000808,"Of the several terrorist attacks since and including 11 Sep, 2001, the Sep 11 attacks probably had the largest world wide impact. The train bombing in Spain and the tube bombing in London both produced limited results, largely because those were local modes of travel. The Sep 11 hijackings are more an international nature, and it also struck at the world's sole superpower. There is something inherently more horrific about an air-crash, viz Lockerbie. Symbolism as well as number of victims both play a part in target selection. So, once more, to strike terror into the world, the terrorists will go back to planes, and their concept of operation will be the simultaneous in-air explosions of multiple US carriers. Terrorists in groups of 2 or 3 will board flights originating in the US, and with destinations domestically and internationally. The explosives, detonators and fuzes will be carried internally in the same manner that drug mules smuggle their cargo. A ceramic or obsidian blade will also be smuggled aboard. At the designated time in flight, two terrorists will have to go to the lav together; if they have a third accomplice, he can act as a shield or distraction to prevent other passengers from seeing the other two enter the same lav. In the lav, one of the terrorists will kill the mule; then using the smuggled ceramic blade, must now disembowel the other terrorist in order to retrieve the explosives. Because one can swallow only so much cargo, the explosives will have to be military grade HE, like RDX or PETN. In the bathroom, the bomb is assembled; the terrorist exits the lav, and uses the same ceramic blade to relock the lav from the outside to prevent other people from accidentally discovering the disemboweled terrorist. The bomb will then have to be detonated somewhere vulnerable, probably over the wing box, or in the tail-section. A sufficiently determined suicide terrorist cannot be stopped. With this action, they have once again showed that they are willing to martyr themselves for their cause, and not even the increased security of the world's greatest superpower can detect and prevent intentional downings of commercial aircraft, and that there is no where safe for anyone. X-raying shoes are not the answer.",Rudy,2006-04-30 17:29:00
c56066,a000808,"I hope this makes it in, it's kind of at the wire, but it's been a busy month and I was out of town this weekend. It has elements of several other people's, but I came up with it before looking through the list, so hopefully I'll get originality for tying them all together and being more coherent than some . . . -- It's 4:15 PM, and Joe Castle was sitting in the DHS Command bunker in downtown Washington DC. The bunker was put in place two years ago, the budget items covered with black marker or simply not existing in some places in the Congressional record. Despite the millions on hardening against NBC threats, super-redundant communication links, and the underground monorail that connected them out to the tunnels that ran between the various congressional buildings and the Library of congress, he still couldn't get a decent cup of coffee. He thought about ducking out to go to the coffee shop in Union Station, but he didn't think it was worth the 20 minute trip out, and then the 35 minute trip back in (each checkpoint he pass would a good 3-5 minutes to his trip). Perhaps in the next procedural review he could get an exception for Drinks On Demand, allowing them courier priveleges and putting them on the pre-approved list so he could get a good cup of Java while it was still hot . . . who would question a line item add for a ""DOD Courier . . .?"" He gazed across the monitors, a chaotic babble of information from dozens of different feeds -- closed circuit of most of the major downtown intersections, the George Washington Univerisity campus cameras, CNN, MSNBC, and several of the local news stations. Other monitors were quieter, but the still poured information to those who watched. . . the latest dumps from AT&T and other ISP's, courtesy of the NSA, a variety of early warning sensors from around the net and SCADA systems across the country, with large ""protected by Cisco"" banners flashing on important looking flatscreens when he happened to walk past them and they would look good in a shot. As he sighed and walked across to the pathetic government instant coffee stand in the corner, his view halted on on monitor that was showing the early early early evening not quite afternoon news on the local Fox channel. He stopped not because of the headlines, the same old same old, more dead in Iraq, more bad things happening locally in society, but because of the moment of recognition when he saw the perfect teeth and purposely blank expression of Tricia Tattler, and felt a pang of regret. He hadn't seen Tricia in two weeks, since they had finally parted ways -- the tension between his having to keep his work secret and her burning desire for a juicy lead had finally pushed them apart. But he still couldn't help but think of how things could have been in a happier time, so he stopped and watched until the end of the segment. ""That's all Jim. And now, we'll go to Bob in our traffic center, for traffic on the eights. Bob, how's the rush hour shaping up?"" ""Well Tricia, if it's not one thing, it's another. We have a back up forming on the American Legion Bridge on the outer loop heading in to Virginia due to a disabled truck, which apparently couldn't make it all the way across, so we're down a lane with no shoulder, and of course the folks headed back to Maryland are rubbernecking and slowing the flow going the other way. We're getting reports of another truck broken down on the Wilson bridge as well, more details as we get them. I guess it's just not a good day for the rental companies. I bet a lot of commuters wish those folks had picked a different day to move. As always, we'll have another update every 10 minutes until 7 PM, but now to the weather."" Joe looked at the grainy traffic camera view before the camera popped over to the Hank, the Washington Weather Wizard. He thought sure he could see several other trucks bearing rental company markings on the other side of the Wilson bridge in the rubbernecking . . . did one of them have it's flashers on? He dropped thoughts of coffee from his mind, and quick-walked over to his console, and began pulling up images from the traffic feeds. While he typed away and clicked with his mouse, he flipped his desk audio through some of the feeds until he got the one he wanted running in the background . . . ""Ten Ten WINS, the most listend to radio station in the country, serving all of New York City, with traffic and weather every ten minutes on the tens. It's a shaping up to be one heck of a rush hour today . . . someone's going to get a ticket, but that's not much comfort -- it appears that not one but TWO drivers have chosen to ignore rush hour tunnel restrictions, and now we are looking at gridlock in the Lincoln AND Holland tunnels. I'd hate to be them when the police finally make it there, but that's not going to help anyone get home faster. The damage has already been done. And, it appears that if you are trying to head out the other side of the city, you're out of luck there too there's a snarl developing on the Brooklyn Bridge, a minor accident between several cars and a mid-sized container truck have brought things to a standstill, and there is major backup on the BQE heading towards Staten Island, due to a disabled vehicle on the lower span -- we haven't been able to get a good look in there, so cell callers, if you are stuck that neighborhood, give us a ring and let us know what's going on. Up at the George Washington Bridge, again on the lower span, there is some type of impasse, details as we get them. But really folks, this might be a good time to hit that happy hour and try again in a few hours. At least the subway's running fine . . ."" Joe had pulled up the NYMTA feeds on the bridges in question, and looked at similar scenes to those in DC . . . Penske here, Ryder there, Uhaul for one or two, but in each case, he was looking at different flavors of rental container trucks sitting parked or wrecked on major bottlenecks . . . all bridges. He began to feel the pit of his stomach drop down to where his toes were, if he could feel them through the growing cold that was enveloping his body. He scrambled for the speeddials on his phone -- the damn things hadn't been programmed properly yet, and he managed after a few rings to get ""Welcome to Audix. To set up your voice mailbox, please press pound."" He clicked to a new line, and dialed his buddy Rick up in NYC from memory. The phone rang as he pulled up Baltimore, and then Boston. The phone clicked. ""Rick --"" ""Hi, this is Rick MaJeure of the DHS, NYC field office. I'm not at my desk right now, but if you would like to leave a message . . . "" Joe swore in frustration, and hung up. The phone rung almost immediately, and he looked -- no Caller ID available. What the heck, he thought? Aren't we the DHS? Can't we get decent caller ID? He punched over to that line. ""To set up your normal busy greeting, press one. To set up your away greeting, press two. To set up an extended absence greeting, press three . . ."" With a howl of annoyance, Joe slammed down the phone on the automated voice. Of course! He had Rick's cell phone number in his cell . . . he pulled out his Razr and flipped it open, and then remembered he was in the bunker. No signal down here, except for DHS approved CO-OP devices, which there was a relay for. His personal cell wasn't on it. He flipped to Rick's entry, and began punching it into the desk phone, and turned his gaze back to the monitors. He was on the next two digits past the 212 area code when he froze. One by one, the monitors were going a bright, bright white, and then nothing. . . Ten minutes later, as DHS staff and military attaches ran through the bunker, orders were shouted, and everyone seemed to be talking and trying to do things at once, a variety of empty screens still glared from the traffic monitoring sections. In one or two cases, news feeds showed shaky chopper shots from a distance, showing plumes of smoke rising from the thin, shattered shapes of bridges off in the distance, as the news choppers observed no-fly zones while getting in as close to the story as possible. Joe's phone rang again, and he snapped it up reflexively, only then looking at the display. Crud!! -- it was Tricia, and he had picked it up.  ""Joe?"" ""Tricia, this is NOT a good time."" ""Joe, what's going on?"" ""Trish, look, really, I'll tell you as soon as we can tell anyone. You know I can't give you any more than that, and I sure as hell am not going to speculate."" ""Dangit Joe, this isn't about work, I'm scared. Look, I'll trade -- I have information for YOU. I'll tell you what I know, and maybe it will help everyone out. Joe, people in the streets are going crazy. We've got our ""men on the street"" types downstairs, and people are saying there's been some sort of an attack, and there's no way out of the city."" ""Well, there may be some routes that have been impaired. We're looking in to that. But you and I know that already."" ""But that's not just it Joe. Joe, we're getting call after call, saying that people are acting strangely, that something else is going on. We've had callers from Dupont Circle and Federal Center saying that people are running around, foaming from the mouths. Some people appear to have collapse, and there are people running everywhere. We just got a call in from someone at L'Enfant saying that some man had walked into the Mall there, and was spraying an aeresol can around, and that people near him started coughing and choking and running away. And now . . . hold on . . . Pete is saying that we're getting similar reports from Times Square and the financial district, near Wall Street in New York."" Joe didn't think his stomach could get any tighter or lower. But suddenly he was fighting to keep his bowels in his body, literally and figuratively as fear gripped him and twisted deep inside. ""Trish, listen to me,"" Joe intoned, trying to stay calm. ""Stay there, stay inside, keep your co-workers inside and try to shut off the building, or at least your part. There may be some sort of bioweapons at work. Please, stay on the line, for god's sake, don't put this on the air right away -- I'll try to get you everything I can, but just stay there and stay put, OK?"" ""Trish? Trish, are you there . . . ?"" Will the United States survive? Will Joe find Trish in the ashes of DC? Will the horrors of terrorism show them the value of the important things in life, so that they can put aside their differences and live together happily in the bunker as riots continue unabated outside, as shipping routes for ground transport are disrupted and the american press and public spend a week ironing out what really is going on and what is only hysteria? And, most important of all, will Joe ever find a truly great cup of coffee? Coming to local theatres next spring, be on the lookout for ""One Mean Cup of Joe . . .""  ----------------------------------- Assume the maxes here -- 30 terrorists, and the best budget you can do ($500,000).

Terrorists should still be able to garner fake credentials easily, or, for those with clean records, just rent in their own names and credit lines (albeit separated from any transactions that might tie in on the explosives side. -- assume average of $1500 for 20' truck for a week * 20 = $30,000 traffic incidents -- timing is somewhat essential, but not pinpoint -- once evening rush hour has started, ground response times are going to suck in most locations. Fake accidents (or minor accidents) or breakdowns can be staged/created so that people who are running ahead are in time -- you could even detail a few terrorists to other vehicles other than the trucks depending on what your target list is. But rush hour is free. This plan is mainly focused on the east coast, due to proximity and population density concerns -- so you would want it in the middle or slightly earlier in the East Coast rush hour, so that the maximum confusion without any chance for advance planning would take place (with most people still needing to leave the city). -- free 9	NYC -- GW, other side from GW, Lincoln, Holland, Brooklyn, Battery Park tunnel, Verrazano, Goethals, and South Gate (name?) of Staten Island -- some of these could these could be deprioritized if most of them were gone.
	7	DC -- American Legion, Wilson, 5 Potomac River Crossings in the city (lower priority) -- Anacostia river crossings don't matter once the 
Wilson Bridge is gone
	2	Baltimore -- harbor tunnel and 95 tunnel -- this is not completely debilitating, but requires traffic to go around the Balimore Beltway, significantly increasing time and congestion    Expanding out (this list can go on and on . . . ) 1/2	Boston's ""Big Dig""
	1/2	DC/Alexandria's ""Mixing Bowl""
	2	Chicago -- with the current contstruction, taking out something near the 90/94 exchange (the sky way would be prime) and blowing up a chunk of the Dan Ryan (currently under construction for the next umpteen years, and already a traffic nightmare . . . There's also a bridge East of chicago that goes through a quarry, is under construction, and seems to carry 90% of the truck traffic going to Chicago from Indiana these days   You could widen the campaign across the country and lessen the impact . . . unless you had a higher budget (or, considering my numbers are probably way high, you could probably squeeze out a bunch more truck bombs than what I detailed). The goal of the ""truck thing"" in this manner is to sever road arteries -- may US cities have a limited number bridge crosssings, and many of them are including vital interstates. The initial terror and dischord will then be followed by crippling long-term traffic and shipping problems for the cities and ports involved -- sever the main bridges, and New York, Baltimore, and DC are all in an immense amount of traffic pain for potentially YEARS while they scramble to rebuild (see the current DC Wilson Bridge project and mixing bowl, and how long they are taking to progress). Then, Part II . . . Biowarfare and misinformation -- this is the other key part of the plan . . . sow terror, through any means neccessary. Once gunshy cities are reminded of 9/11 again in a frightening burst of deja vu, people will see similarities to the first time around -- fueled by the terrorists. After the explosions and transportation issues have been set in motion, the remaining terrorists could strike through information only . . . but if budget allowed, a small level, highly visible public toxin attack in the affected cities could be grounds for HUGE panic, if it is followed up effectively with enough disinformation. Let's take 4 of our remaining terrorists, and set them up in isolated locations with high-speed connections, decent computers, skype-out/yahoo voice/other VOIP-landline services, and have them start hitting every news source they can think of -- call in to 911, tip lines, traffic report lines, police watch lines, etc . . . if well prepared, one terrorist could simultaneously unleash dozens of calls, and then trigger pre-recorded audio cues of distressed citizens wailing about the panic and horrible things in the background, without really needing any actual interaction, and then dropping the connection, possibly with the implication of something horrible happening to the caller. Let say a whopping $10,000 to outfit each of these guys (way more than needed, but what the hey) -- $40,000 That takes us up to $270,000 so far and 6 terrorists remaining. I'm guessing with some time to work on it, with almost $40,000 per person, you could dig up some decent fear-inducing bioweapons or toxins. They don't even have to be fatal, they just have to scare the heck out of people, and cause doubt in the infrastructure and cause weeks or months of clean-up work. A few anthrax-laden letters shutdown a post office in DC for YEARS, not just a few weeks. So, 6 * $38,333 per = $230,000. Obviously, I am not an explosives expert, the size of trucks and amount of charges and cost might need to be tweaked, but there is tons of headroom in this plan to juggle the numbers. And, if you scaled down the vehicle targets, that too makes for more freedom in the bottom line. The real damage is going to be caused by the normal daily routine of all these cities and this country's citizens trying to complete their daily routine in a panic, and then the painful, long, extended cleanup that has to follow . . . so -- total cost of		$500,000 20 trucks worth of explosives -- $200,000
20 truck rentals	 -- $30,000
regular US city commuting snafu -- free
misinformation		 -- $40,000
biowarfare		 -- $230,000

c56067,a000808,"Take two... It seems to me that the September 11, 2001 attacks were just about ""perfect"" from the attacker's point of view. Since then there have many changes made to try to stop anything like that from ever happening again. As you can't improve on ""perfection"", my most evil plot is that the terrorists manage to repeat the performance (with just small and simple modifications to cleverly sidestep all the upgraded security procedures) added since 2001. So, in addition to the terror generated by the success of another round of similar attacks, we have the added effect of everybody seeing how ineffective all the attempts to improve security over the last 5 years have really been. What will the government and other authorities be able to say or do if the same attack succeeds a second time? And who will ever believe them again anyway... ",evil C,2006-04-30 18:28:00
c56071,a000808,"The attacks began midmorning on the Friday after Thanksgiving. Thirty minutes after a large regional mall in rural South Carolina opened for its traditional after-Thanksgiving sale, a bomb exploded in the center atrium. Placed at the bottom of a trash receptacle, the bomb consisted of nothing more than a timer, a blasting cap, and dynamite, covered with 30 pounds of ball bearings. The explosion shattered most of the plate-glass display windows and sent shrapnel flying in all directions. Over 400 people were killed instantly and well over a thousand—there were too many for a precise count—were wounded. A television crew sent to interview shoppers about the sale was standing just inside the west entrance and was broadcasting live to the local morning talk show when the bomb detonated. The blast tore off most of the reporter’s right arm and decapitated the woman she was interviewing, as the inevitable slow-motion replays later demonstrated. The camera crew, shielded from the blast by a concrete pillar, escaped serious injury and continued to broadcast unedited pictures of the slaughter. An alert staffer at the television station notified the network, and less than five minutes after the explosion, the national audience was viewing live pictures of bloodied shoppers stumbling and crawling toward the exits. The local emergency plan, designed to cover floods and hurricanes, never anticipated having to treat so many seriously injured people at the same time. Doctors and paramedics who rushed to the scene were overwhelmed by the scale of the carnage. The nearest hospital was more than 20 minutes away, no available transportation could move hundreds of wounded at a time, and the hospital had only 30 beds and no trauma center. Consequently, the medical teams treated the wounded in the parking lot, inadequately equipped with supplies scavenged from the Wal-Mart across the street and nearby drug stores. By noon, the television cameras could no longer avoid showing the growing pile of severed arms and legs as doctors gave up all hope of reconstructing the shattered limbs of the victims. Even with industrial-scale amputations, the medical teams could not possibly deal with all of the injured, and more than half of them died before they could be treated. Their bodies were stacked in the far corner of the parking lot and incinerated with borrowed gasoline as darkness fell. Within an hour of the South Carolina explosion, a dozen similar attacks on regional malls and shopping centers were confirmed as viewers watched footage arriving from such disparate places as western Massachusetts, upstate New York, central Pennsylvania, tidewater Virginia, and northern Alabama. It appeared at first that the large cities had been spared, since new reports from the Midwest were coming from rural Ohio, southern Indiana, central Iowa, and northeastern Missouri. Then a news flash from Chicago announced that the first floor of the city’s largest downtown department store had been hit by at least three explosions that caused a partial collapse of the second and third floors. Estimates of the number of dead and wounded were not immediately available. As new bombs popped up on colorful television maps, the western movement of the attacks became obvious. By the time the President addressed the nation from the White House at noon and called for calm, shopping centers throughout the country were ghost towns. Most of the employees of the stores fled with the customers, leaving their supervisors wondering how to recoup the losses of what should have been the biggest sales day of the year. Rural police and fire departments were uncomfortably aware all of the attacks except the Chicago bombing were taking place in jurisdictions like theirs, and they searched for bombs as best they could. But they had no experience in finding or disarming explosives, despite having accepted billions of dollars in grants from the Department of Homeland Security for training their personnel to respond to terrorist attacks. Only in central Nebraska did a sheriff’s deputy manage to find and disarm one of the devices before it detonated, and she admitted that discovering it was pure dumb luck. With the malls evacuated, the 10 attacks west of the Mississippi River caused mainly property damage. They produced only 31 deaths—23 employees of the stores and malls, 3 police officers, and 5 firefighters. By sunset on Friday, 27 malls had been bombed. Except for the Chicago department store, all the attacks struck regional malls in rural areas. Nearly 10,000 people were dead; no one knew how many were wounded. The number of deaths kept increasing as emergency care facilities were overwhelmed and unable to treat all the wounded. One reporter tried to put the losses in perspective by observing that over the next year, more Americans would be killed by drunk drivers than were killed in the mall bombings. The media’s attention was diverted briefly from its round-the-clock coverage of the attacks as commentators and pundits excoriated the hapless reporter. Within two hours his network pulled him from their lineup. By Saturday, television stations had preempted all programs and were running nothing but news without commercial breaks. However, with nothing new happening, the air time was filled with updates on the overloaded medical facilities near the bombing sites, endless videos of the dead and dying, and commentary by pundits who turned out to know little about terrorism. The pressing need to fill broadcast time led to some bizarre episodes. The Commerce Secretary urged Americans to return to their local malls and spend as much as they could to make up for the business losses of Friday. One commentator suggested a nuclear attack on France. Religious leaders who had gleefully argued that the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington were evidence of divine retribution for urban wickedness eagerly appeared for interviews but proved reluctant when asked to explain why terror had come to the heartland. On Sunday, a new wave of bombings struck gas stations across the country between midnight and dawn. In all, 287 stations were hit, all located in middle-class and upper-income bedroom communities. Many of the fires caused by the explosions spread to nearby residential areas, destroying thousands of homes and killing 95 firefighters and over 2,500 others. The gas station bombings cut the usually heavy traffic of Thanksgiving Sunday by more than two-thirds. Many people refused to travel, imagining that they might be blown up as they fueled their cars. More than 30% of the American workforce failed to report for work on Monday morning, though no one was sure how much of that was directly linked to people who did not return home on Sunday. Investigations showed how easy it was to attack the gas stations. All 287 stations were closed on Saturday evening. The terrorists simply drove up, dropped their bombs in the trash cans next to the pumps, and drove off without alarming anyone or even attracting attention. A single terrorist could easily have delivered 10 or 15 bombs in a 40-mile radius in just a few hours. On Monday morning, stores began opening for the first time since Friday. Most shoppers stayed away from malls and downtown shopping areas, and there were no lines at gas stations. By contrast, grocery stores were jammed with customers who apparently felt safe in their local markets. Shortly after noon Eastern Standard Time, sixty-one bombs exploded in supermarkets in the 20 largest American cities. Two bombs that failed to explode were discovered late Monday in Denver, each a simple dynamite bomb buried deep in the frozen food section sealed in a plastic bag that had contained Brussels sprouts. Fewer people died on Monday morning than were killed in the Friday mall attacks, Even so, almost 1,200 people were killed and more injured, many of whom were trampled as shoppers stampeded out of the markets. The immediate effect of the attacks was that Americans were afraid to leave home, and they shunned retail businesses. People were wary of going anywhere that had crowds or that might be a target of a bomb. Gas stations reported most people pumped only a few gallons of gas into their cars before speeding away. (Highway statistics showed that the number of traffic accidents, which had been decreasing for years, rose sharply after the Thanksgiving attacks. Statisticians attributed most of the increase to nervous drivers eager to escape from harm's way.) Retail businesses started to fail and unemployment rose quickly. For weeks, no one claimed credit for the attacks. The government was unable to discover who the attackers were, or whether they were foreign or domestic. And then, on December 21, the terrorists released a communiqué revealing that the bombings were carried out by 28 individuals spending less than $500,000. The communiqué never specified the reasons for the attacks; its tedious and ambiguous political diatribe led conspiracy theorists to blame everyone imaginable: the Israelis, the British Queen, the Catholic Church, the Environmental Liberation Front, Sufi mystics, the Dalai Lama, even the Paraguayans. Of greater interest was the terrorists’ description of exactly how they carried out the attacks with so little money and so few people. They recruited disaffected members from their communities based on two criteria: ability to learn another language, and a physical appearance that Americans would be likely to mistake for Hispanic. (Later intelligence revealed that about a third of the terrorists were light-skinned and went to tanning salons or used tanning products to darken their skin tones to resemble more closely the American stereotype of the working-class Hispanic.) Before the terrorists entered the United States, they attended language schools in Mexico and Guatemala and learned enough Spanish to pass as Mexicans or Central Americans. Once they were in the United States, it was easy to obtain fake IDs and green cards in the larger metropolitan areas. Cleaning services in malls were only too happy to hire apparent Hispanics willing to work at the minimum wage and without benefits or complaints. (This statement led intelligence officials to theorize that the attackers had placed their bombs in supermarkets on Monday morning while posing as shoppers.) Looking like Hispanic janitors, the terrorists drew no attention in the malls and had no problem planting their bombs, which had been easily assembled from readily-available materials with very little technical training. The communiqué boasted that the attack team had learned how to assemble and arm the dynamite bombs in a single weekend. It is unclear whether the terrorists intended to use their communiqué to hammer a socioeconomic wedge into America, but that was certainly its effect. Many non-Hispanic Americans announced their suspicions of all Hispanics, whether illegal or not, even though nobody could describe who was a Hispanic and who wasn’t, or how to recognize one. Race riots became commonplace as gangs of vigilantes punished those they suspected as possible terrorists. With law and order breaking down and the economy heading south, the President considered imposing martial law, but the Middle Eastern wars had decimated the National Guard, and the U.S. Army was spread too thin by its overseas commitments to offer much help. One insurance company after another announced that its policies did not cover terrorist attacks. There would be no insurance money for rebuilding the malls or for replacing the homes burned in the fires. For those killed who were lucky enough to have life insurance, two-thirds of the policies did not cover death by terrorism. On a cold morning in February, the President attended a ceremony at the site of the South Carolina mall to honor the dead and wounded. The mall had stood empty since the day after Thanksgiving. None of the insurance companies would pay for the damage from the attack because of the terrorism exclusion in their policies; none of the owners or tenants had enough money for repairs; no investor wanted to take on the task of cleansing the blood that had stained the walls and floors; and no government funds were available to restore the mall. When he agreed to speak, the President hoped his words would give inspiration and hope and comfort. But political and economic realities forced him to devote most of his speech to defending his policies on rapidly rising unemployment and the skyrocketing cost of imports—especially oil—that accompanied the collapse of the dollar on international money markets. It was hard to decide which was more melancholy: his words, or the ruined shopping mall 200 yards in back of him. Following the President’s speech, and after a long and very Protestant prayer by a local minister, the President’s wife stepped up to the podium and touched two thick cables to an automobile battery. Within seconds, carefully-placed explosive charges reduced the mall to a mound of rubble.",Otario,2006-04-30 20:43:00

c56082,a000808,"The Chosen-Microphone Attack. This attack, as the name implies, requires access to the microphone(s).  One possible scenario is the American Idol finale show (live and insanely popular).  An adversary gains access to the audio equipment and locates the microphone which will be used by the contestant who wins, to sing a closing song.  The microphone is disassembled.  A small chamber containing a highly poisonous, odorless, tasteless, and colorless gas is fitted inside, with a mechanism for release.  The mechanism must first be activated, remotely, through the use of a cell phone, and triggered by the contestant's voice, upon singing into the microphone.  The ""trigger-man,"" which may or may not be the same adversary who planted the device, may be in the audience, or within cell phone range.  After being triggered, the gas is inhaled by the contestant; to achieve greater societal impact, the gas must act quickly as to cause the contestant to collapse while viewers are watching.  It may be plausible to extend this attack to other significant scenarios, such as a presidential address; it may be even more plausible to realize an attack from this angle when the significant individual is speaking in a location where access to the audio equipment is less restricted (i.e., a high school or university, versus a government building).",Justin,2006-04-30 22:54:00

- io  ""Communication Breakdown""
Summary: evildoers launch a well coordinated attack to cause massive, lasting disruptions in  communications and also facilitate economic division between the US and foreign countries. The 30 terrorists break into smaller groups of 3-5 each in order to divide and conquer. Step 1) Create an environment of fear, uncertainty, and doubt:
Terrorist contact black market spammers and pay them to deliver their message via spam.  In short,  the message reads ""We will take away your Internet - Remember 9-11-2008!"" (with further embellishment to promote their cause and to attract recruits, and so on...)  There's no virus, spyware, or tracking in the message, but the message makes people worry.  The message gets delivered (and read) in the majority of American homes, and the flurry of news reports about the ""terrorist spam"" spread the word to everyone else. 9/11/2008 arrives with much anticipation, but passes without incident.  As time passes, people forget about the threat.  The 11/2008 election arrives with much security and much attention to computerized voting, but again, passes without (terrorist induced) incident. Step 2) The coordinated attack:
11/9/2008 - almost immediately after the next presidential election
Morning:  Terrorist attack the Internet interconnect points.  Much to everyone's surprise, it is a   physical attack, not a software attack.  They target locations where the Internet is physically most vulnerable.  The primary targets are the MAE facilities, the major interconnect point for the Internet: MAE East in Washington DC (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAE-East), MAE West, other major interconnect points across the country, etc.  Other targets could include (all of) the primary DNS servers, ... (you get the idea - the list goes on and is too easy to make.)  Note that not only are the interconnections broken, but the equipment that did so is now vaporized.  Where possible, the terrorist use a dirty bomb (a terror cliché, but it works here!) so that it is not possible to redeploy equipment in the effected area.  It takes months to deploy new fiber and create new interconnects.  (Yes, Internet traffic can take a different route on the network, but the alternate routes don't have the capacity to handle all of the redirected traffic and become instantly overloaded.)  Then ""newsworthyness"" of the event only adds to the complications, and the Internet (in the US, at least) grinds to a halt.  The body count is anywhere from 50-200 per bombing, depending on the facility and bomb size. Afternoon: Terrorists isolate the US from international communications
A few of the small 3 person terrorist micro-cells trained in scuba and buy/steal small fishing  boats.  They travel 10 miles offshore where they cut trans-oceanic telecommunications lines in the Atlantic and Pacific.  They tow one end of the fiber to ""parts unknown"" so that it can't be easily reparied.  Communications overseas is still possible, but highly disrupted.  The surviving trans-oceanic lines are so overloaded, they aren't usable. Within 24 hours:  Disruption of US dependence on international commerce
A couple of the micro-cells work outside of the US.  They bomb several key processor chip  manufacturing facilities in Asia.  Hundreds of workers are added to the body count. Computers and other devices which rely on the chips cannot be manufactured for many months, making a long term impact to the communication disruption.  Again, use your imagination. Step 3) The impact:
People mistakenly attribute ""normal"" computer/internet problems to ""new"" terrorist activity  (terrorist hacked my computer again!) When computer/Internet problems arise, terrorism is in the back of people's minds as the cause.  DHS forms a special internet security subdepartment, and much personal freedom/privacy on the Internet is given up in the name of security.  Much time and money is diverted into Internet security in preparation for an attack (think pre Y2K hype).  Internet security becomes a minor election year topic. Internet communications across the US and internationally is significantly disrupted, and the impact has a ripple effect on all of the economies that rely on it.  People quickly notice the impact because of lack of connectivity to their call centers which are now overseas.  Many businesses, including medical teleradiology (which is frequently outsourced, especially in at night) are greatly impacted.  For brevity, I'll leave the rest of this to the imagination, but the impact is huge. The policy of the new Presidential administration focuses on the attack, and how to prevent the same attack from happening again.  Many other areas that need the government's attention are neglected in the meantime. International communication is significantly disrupted, further driving a wedge between the US and the rest of the world.  Others learn not to rely as much on the US for the Internet. Billions are spent on security to protect and physically monitor the trans-oceanic lines (even though terrorist would move on to a new target next time.) Conclusion:
There is no conclusion.  Citizens of the US are left with a hollow, vulnerable feeling knowing how  much of their economy and way of life depend on fragile ties to the rest of the world.  The economic ripple is felt for years to come. ",io,2006-05-04 15:41:00

As a prerequisite you have to ramp up the anthrax fears as they where shortly after 911
spray a white powder over large public gatherings. The super bowl and Macy's parade are obvious targets for the numnumts (like al'quedea) but security is probably up to it. Smart terrorists would attack regular footbal, baseball, cricket (m an aussie) matches with large crowds, and lower security. 
As a payload, white acrylic house paint suitably diluited and delivered by crop duster. you need ""white powder"" to induce panic, so the anthrax scare from a few years ago needs to be current. Mas panic will cause significant deaths, the ability to exploit and public gathering would allow unlimited fear to be created.    A second variation, a presurised envolope of white powder, talc will do. If people are previously conditioned to  fear white powders, there are a vast number of bulk mailing organizations that could deliver your payload, and don't require serious id.

c58111,a000808,"The rules: 20 to 30 people and $500.000 Since the resources are restricted, we need to think of attacks that are very easy to execute yet have a long impact. I don't deny the effect of a big all out attack, but the sniper in Washington seemed to do a really good job too. First, we'll divide the 30 people into several groups. Group 1: 12 people spread across 6 major US cities. This group will inject random food and drinks in the big supermarkets with a lethal poison. People might mistake it for accidents at first, but as the attacks go on, they won't. This is also where group 2 comes in. Group 2: 2 people will be the propaganda team. They will write letters to the city council of target cities of group 1 and the press stating specifically that they are targetting those cities and it's citizens and that everyone in those cities is at risk. They will also state that more attacks will follow and that they will get worse. After a few weeks, enter Group 3. Group 3: 8 people will spread to the 8 different major cities to snipe it's citizens. Group 2 will again inform the media. Group 4: the remaining 8 people start going to work as arsonists. They will work co-ordinated, meaning that they will set ablaze several different homes at opposite sides in the same city at the same time so that firefighters become overwhelmed. They will repeat this in different major cities throughout the US. This result will not cause 3000 victims at once but it will create chaos. It will attack the familiar and safe environments of the targets. People will no longer trust the food and drinks they buy. People will no longer dare to walk the streets and people will no longer dare to go to sleep due to fires set to homes. This will cause tremendous stress on the population and it's productivity. It might also cause (racial) riots etc, Group 2 (the 'pr' team could help start these).  Due to the spread-out nature and the low-techness of the attacks law enforcement and intelligence agencies will effectively have a very low chance of making any arrests soon, so the stretch of the attacks is at least a month in my opinion (this can be influenced by measures such as martial law and curfews, at which point all groups would immediately cease their activities, only to resume them as soon as those measures are lifted again). Due to the longer period during which these attacks can continue, they are more likely to cause the population to become burned-out and extremely tired and stressed than to cause defiance with the population, especially when the authorities seem relatively powerless to stop them.",Menso,2006-05-15 07:32:00

c58123,a000808,"Since the recent Cryptogram said I can ignore the April 30 deadline, here is my contribution to the string of terrorist plots.  It encapsulates pieces of many previous ideas, but the (new?) idea is to leverage one terrorist attack off the other. Divide your strike group of 30 terrorists:  one group of 20 and a second group, UNKNOWN to the first, of 10.  Group A, which thinks it is THE terrorist group, is split into small cells (3-4).  Each cell is tasked with attacking government officials in small and midsized towns:  city council meetings, mayors, town managers, public works directors, etc.  Accomplishing this would require only publically available data and easily available weapons.  In my town, for instance, if there is any security for a town council meeting, it consists of one off-duty police officer.  It would be very easy to scout the location, show up at the meeting, kill and wound dozens, and then leave.  If the targets were widely scattered, it would be impossible to predict where they would strike. The power of these attacks is three-fold.  First, these are very soft targets.  It will be easy to pull off a number of attacks before security is tightened.   And even if security is tightened, a simple variation in types of attacks (e.g. shifting from attacks on public meetings to attacks in private homes) will keep the new security from being effective. Second, it has a very high panic factor because it strikes at the ""heartland.""  After the anthrax attacks in DC, there were panicked reports of anthrax all over the place, including many in small towns.  Should attacks actually occur in small towns, this panic factor would be multiplied many times. The third feature of these attacks is that they are a deliberate distraction.  These attacks would generate a LOT of media attention, and would put pressure on the government to respond.  A temporary but large shift in security forces would occur; literally, the government would be looking the other way when the ""real"" attack occurs. Group B, which is not known to Group A and is operationally separate, is tasked with planning an attack against a single, high profile ECONOMIC target, say the NYSE or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  These targets are currently guarded, and a spate of attacks would cause some heightened security.  However, since all the group A attacks are against public sector targets in small and medium towns, there would be a tendency to expect the pattern to continue.  Thus, police in Chicago could well be pulled off the Mercantile Exchange and shifted to City Hall. The Group B attack, if successful, would have major reprecussions.  First, it would have a significant economic impact.  The closure of the Mercantile Exchange for even a few days would have a powerful negative impact on all the world markets.  Second,  the terror factor would be multiplied because we would be blind-sided.  Having been conditioned to expect public-sector attacks (or even having experienced relief when one or more cells from Group A is caught), a new attack in a different sector would be that much more powerful:  no one would know where to expect the next attack, and so people would be blindly preparing for every possible attack.","David Cruz-Uribe, SFO",2006-05-15 08:37:00

* 10-15 bottles of ""octane booster"" fluid from the auto department
* a bag of nitro fertilizer from the garden department
* gunpowder from a few hunting rifle cartridges for a fuse
* a cell phone to be modified into a trigger     Teams of 2 people get into rented vehicles and cruise through the Midwest, stopping at every WalMart they see, purchasing materials locally and leaving the bomb inside the store. The bomb has to look inconspicuous (e.g. a gas can hidden among 50 other gas cans in the auto isle). With some training, 2-3 bombs can be done in a day by each team, or 40-60 bombs a day by the entire group. Nearly every discount store (not just WalMart, that would be unfair) in an enire state can be targeted within a week. Then, bombs are triggered in waves using cell phone triggers - the first one looks like ""some kids fooling around"", then comes half a dozen ""copycats"", and then wave after wave of bombs - until all installations have been either ""used"" or found. Stores will institute security checkpoints - but they will be useless because all materials came from inside the store. This point would then be driven home by making a few more bombs.

c58167,a000808,"So many possibilities...  One idea I came up with a few years ago was prompted not by terrorism, but by watching the response of police to a shooting.  A man shot at a police car (not actually injuring anyone - though not for lack of trying), and what seemed like every policeman in the metro area converged to take care of the threat. My thought was how easy it would be to rob a bank at that point. Similarly - what a great distractor to allow the real attack: Step 1) sniper teams draw police response by simply shooting at police cars at long range (not necessarily trying to hit the occupants, in fact - preferably allowing them to call in the response!)
Step 2) the teams disengage by leapfrogging out of the area - the first time this technique is used, the police will assume a single sniper rather than multiple supporting teams.
Step 3) once the news media pick this up, several attacks can then occur simultaneously - the best bet would be to focus on one or two high priority targets to be taken out with bombs.
(lacking any particular target - other teams can randomly shoot at individuals - but I think of that as a much lower payoff in terror).
Step 4) have your public relations machine pump out letters to the editor and call-ins to radio and TV shows about how the police car more about themselves than about protecting 'us'.
Step 5) repeat as necessary.      Note- you need perhaps 8 people per metropolitan area to make this happen, and I would expect it to work best in a medium-sized city (250,000 - 3,000,000 people).  Much larger, and your teams will not distract enough of the police force.  Much smaller and there's no real high-payoff target - your groups are also more noticable in a smaller city). 4 random places to hit on the same day, then pick another 4 cities at random and do it again.

There are probably a few more than 20 or 30 of them, but they also don't need $500,000; they can leverage off the infrastructure they already have. It is already known that some terrorists (Islamic Fundamentalists, for example) take great offense at any images that desecrate their sacred beliefs and persons of worship.  Remember the reaction to the cartoon from Denmark?  So, what the movie critics have to do is describe movies and create symbolism in the movies they review that would indicate such desecration and heresy.

Anthrax is highly effective at this ( as we've seen), but wasn't too great as it didn't reach a wide enough range of people or infect that many because it really needs to be breathed in.
So create some anthrax solution and get people to administer it themselves.

Then swap a couple on the production line or distribution centre for some with your bioweapon of choice in. The units are mostly fitted by workers, so they won't notice that they're not smelling quite right immediately. And the cross section of people affected will be so random it'll extremely difficult to identify the source(s).

A fairly small group of people could contaminate a small percentage of  water suppplies over a large geographic area with relative ease. Groups of innocent civilians (maybe tens or hundreds at a time) die here and there around the country within a fairly short time (maybe a week or two) from toxins that are easily traced to their water supply. The media would immediately get wind and the 24-hour news media would whoop it up big.  Within a few weeks, authorities would start tightening security at water sources and facilities, but by then the damage would be done. Across the country, people would fear that their own water was dangerous (just as they fear crime in their own neighborhood based on news reports of crime elsewhere) and panic would break out. The attack might continue, but once people lost faith in the safety of their water supplies, survivalism would take over and communities would break down as everyone tried to insure their own supply of water.

Most of them were thinking in terms of blowing up the Glen Canyon Dam (a hot topic about that time, Edward Abbey's 'The Monkey Wrench Gang' had just hit the GreenPeace best sellers list"" Then, a well oiled guy at the bar swung around and, claiming to be a power systems engineer, said, ""That wouldn't do much to most of the country. If you want to sock it to the USA, you need to do the following: There's public document published by the Commerce Department called 'The Atlas of The United States' that is in most public libraries. Get a copy of and go to the map of the electrical power grid. It shows the rough location of the transport lines of country's power distribution system weighted by capacity. Do a little math and you'll see that over 1/3 of the nation's power crosses the western continental divide at ~17 points. If you really want to mess things up economically for America - build some mortars that can lob a good sized piece of chain over a highline, practice up on how to aim them, build them with a fairly accurate timer that can run for a week or so and set them off within 30 seconds of each other, backpack them into the bushes up on the divide, pick a time sometime in the middle of the summer (say, July 4th) for them to do their thing, and, BOOM! out go te lights, except with a twist. There is a HUGE amount of power stored in the electromagnetic fields surrounding transport power lines when they are operating at high capacity and when the current flow suddenly halts, the fields collapse and it's all injected back into the grid. Whithout something to stop it, it's injected back into the generators at the power plants. ... it would effectively convert the generators into motors that were trying to turn against the rotation of their power sources...) There are elaborate switching systems in place to protect the whole system from these effects but they are designed to cope with a certain probability of event. If you sever the lines that carry 1/3 of the nation's power in the same 30-second interval the event will fall WAY outside the designed capability of the protection systems and a significant fraction of the nation's power generating machinery would be destroyed.

The terrorist even has a decent chance to get away after the attack. In the same vein as the Oklahoma Federal Building bombing or the Great Texas City Fertilizer Plant Disaster . You simply go to Crawford Texas or any town that high poliitical figures may  frequent and under a false identity, you build or buy the seed and fertilizer store and warehouse. You comply with all the regulations and you run the store like any other rural services place. You hire employees and file your taxes and make friends and enemies in the town like anyone else.  You marry a local lass and may even have children. But you hook up the agricultural diesel supply tanks to the fire sprinkler system over the fertilize storage racks where there are tons and tons of ammonium nitrate and install the requisite catalyst explosives underneath locked plates installled in the floors for apparently good reasons, like support sockets for temporary uprights. Then you wait very patiently. When the intended victim or victims are within range, you trip the trap by any easily available remote control device like a cell phone and take advantage of  the hour or so of sheer chaos to get as far away as possible. In my movie, the terrorist trips the trap from a small airplane from which he is spotting his victims and is himself knocked out of the air in the blast. Thus there's even a bit of vengeance from the audience's point of view.... Two small craft were really knocked down in the Texas City blast of 1947, where the range of damage reached around 15 miles, using some 2300 tons of ammonium nitrate. Note that all components are legal and readilly available and that you probably don't even need to invest your own money. You might even earn money while you're doing the waiting.

Analysis shows that the continent of Africa holds enough resouces to allow a permitted socially acceptable group of people to continue thier closeted existence. However, a problem remains in that Africa is an 'emerging' continent and, should the various states decide to co-operate, will become a super-power in its own right. The solution that presents itself to the U.S Government is a simple one: a virus will be engineered that can target a specific sub-goup of the human species. This virus will not have an immediate effect, its effects will not be immediately terminal; instead it will infect the host for many years, causing suffering for those years before eventually killing the host, This will have the dual effect of draining the host's countries resources as well as killing the host itself. The virus will also be engineered to pass through sexual contact; the virus will also be able to recognise treatment history and ignore any previous treatments. As well as being used against the people of Africa, the virus will be used to target other 'socially unacceptable' groups in order to mask its true intent. Pyschologists within the U.S Government have determined that such a virus will grip peoples attention for approximately 1 year then, after that, it will become the 'norm'. After a time period of 200 years, Africa will be bankrupt and its people racked by starvation; the U.S, in the guise of the U.N, can then take over the continent and use its resources as it sees fit.

c58641,a000808,"The Continental Phased Array The scene is Washington, DC. Unbeknownst to the general public, as a component of the domestic war on terror, the government’s Department of Homeland Security has mandated a significant improvement in the ability to locate cellular phones. The intent is to be able to accurately locate any operating cell phone instantly. The telecommunications industry has responded positively, as in the recent past. The capability to locate a handset, initially introduced to support 911 emergency services, has been enhanced with embedded GPS receivers. Cell phones are now able to determine and transmit their locations to the cellular system upon receipt of a specially coded request and without the user’s knowledge. Because the DHS does not understand GPS, no one in the government realizes how accurate theses locations can be. The scene is a terrorist Improvised Explosive Device R&D facility in the desert northwest of Baghdad. While studying ways to use cell phones as remote control detonators, terrorists have discovered the potential of the handset location capability. Employing Russian mathematicians, scientists and hackers, they develop new differential algorithms that can allow a cell phone to determine its location to a fraction of a cellular carrier wavelength and report, among other things, motion and orientation. Combined with a viral delivery system, all cell phones can now be infected with new programming that can silently turn on the carrier wave with good phase control. The ability to form a phased array beam is in place. The final demonstration of the R&D project shows the microwave-oven-like effect of a grid of cell phones mounted on a wall, when beamed at a suitable target. The scene is Baghdad. It is the first field trial of the new terrorist radio weapon. The terrorists run a computer program that infects the cellular system, and then all of the handsets in the city. The program turns on all of the transmitters forming a beam that downs a Blackhawk helicopter. The software removes itself immediately afterward. The source and nature of the attack cannot be determined because each cell phone individually is considered harmless, even though many people suspect they can cause brain damage in the user. They terrorists realize that the cellular carrier wave frequencies reside in the Water Hole, a range of frequencies at which the Earths atmosphere is transparent to electromagnetic transmissions. The terrorists infect cellular systems throughout the world. The resulting beamforming capability can put 1,000,000,000 watts of electromagnetic energy on any target at sufficiently large distance. Using the North American and Indian phased arrays, they disable satellites in orbit around the Earth. Using city-sized arrays they damage aircraft, some of which crash due to control issues. Recall that we couldn’t use cell phones on airplanes until recently. This is an enormous disruption to the Western economies, with relatively minor effects in the less developed parts of the world. It takes a long time to figure out how this is happening. Special Sci-Fi alternate ending: The terrorists realize that a properly oriented subarray can transmit a polarized beam. With careful timing, good weather and the unwitting help of the astrophysical community, they point the beam at the sun, affecting the plasma dynamics and triggering solar flares. The timing is arranged to have the resulting solar storms hit the Earth when it is 12:00 noon in St. Louis, Missouri. The ensuing damage to the power transmission grid is devastating. Alternate alternate: Fortunately, heroic counterhackers discover the software infections and disrupt the beamforming signals and no beam results. Armed with knowledge of the nature of the exploit, the government is able to prevent its repetition. Another Alternate Alternate: The terrorists send a beam to every nearby star. 300 years later the aliens arrive, expecting the original senders to make good on their promises.

Having my hands used in the close-up (directed by Don Ohlmeyer himself while 2nd Unit was wrapping up final footage) to portray the female terrorist picking up and detonating the explosives at the military base was an unecpected perk for me.  There was a lot of controversy in the newspapers before the movie was even shown; some thought it would cause too big of a backlash with the people who were being portrayed as the terrorists.
By the way, if you find a copy on VHS or DVD, I'd love to have one - all I have is what somebody taped on their VCR for me.  I thought it was an awesome flick back then - even more so after 911.  The film won an Emmy for Outstanding Sound.  ",bklynsmom,2006-05-18 13:24:00
c59119,a000808,"Terrorists could do this one cheaply and easily, and I am actually a bit hesitant to put it up. Several teams could base themselves in western US states  like Arizona, New Mexico, Montana, etc during summer, and wait for dryest and hottest part where forests are at their period of least amount of moisture in the fuels (wood, shrubs, grasses). All that would be required for that is just easily made incendiary devices, tossed out a window of a moving car.  If a series of teams did that simultaneously, and each one did multiple fires in one day, many large fires could be created in each state, quickly overwhelming wildland firefighting crews. And in order to ground aerial firefighting  planes and helos, either unguided rockets, or even a real SA-7/14 type missile to actually hit one of them.  USFS will immediately order all firefighting aircraft to not fly. Firefighting crews could be attacked, by means such as shooting, bombing their vehicles or firecamps. Particular attention could be paid to urban areas like San Bernardino, San Diego, Flagstaff where housing areas border right up to dense vegatition areas, resulting in thousands of houses burned potentially. Multiple large fires happening all at ones, with the knowledge they are terrorist acts, and then if terrorists undertook means to attack firefighters, both air and ground based, would cause USFS to not deploy them.

c59444,a000808,"A cheap way to spread FUD (Fear, Uncertainity and Doubt, a tactic often used in the marketing arena to retain customers against aggressive competitors) is to create a fake (but very credible) situation where normal people can believe to be under a very big danger, like a termonuclear explosion. I'm writing a novel where a guy, that wants to fear his own government, use the 500.000 $ to ask a military aircraft pilot to land on an stright highway (blocked at both ends by deadly black SUVs full of heavy armed bad guys): the pilot abandons the aircraft and leaves for a tropical island where he hopes to found the curvaceous blonde that has asked him to partecipate to the plot (the pilot will be shooted or poisoned by the girl after of before a hot sexual scene, of course). Next day, when media have printed/aired news about the misterious aircraft landing (witnessed by lots of cardrivers blocked on the highway), the guy that manouvres the plot behind the scenes, sends the notice to millions of emails, and sends to all media, to all political leaders and influencers (like Oprah and anchormen/women) a movie of the aicraft landing, where a bunch of terrostis take off form the aircraft ""fake"" nuclear bombs.
It is better that the aircraft is a cargo that ""was shipping to a dismantling factory some aged nuclear weapons"" that ""are not under the control of the normal security procedures"".  The terrorist announces to the nation (and the world and the stock exchange too) that the weapons will be used agaist some not disclosed targets; so people know that nuclear explosions will happen, but where? NYC? LA? SF? To activate a dormient vulcan of to start a tsunami? Imagine what a screenplayer and a good director can do: unbelievable scene of pure terrors triggered by a fake plot. After all, if some one says that 11/9 was a governement plot (and many people get rich writing books and producing movies on the subject), why people could not believe to a movie (and related news) where a ""real"" military aircraft has landed as declared by authorities and witnessed by feared cardrivers, hungry teamsters, over-busy sun-glassed policemen on chromate motorbikes?

c61072,a000808,"Here's three, and both can be used in large (country- or world-wide) and small scales (city or building).  At the end I will give an overview of a massive takeover plot, not truly practical for terrorists on a grand scale, but quite sufficient for, say, Manhattan Island, which was used previousally as a target. 1. Rainmakers.  (Pardon me for the silliness of this one.)  Get 50 well trained rainmaker priests to call down the rain across the country or region.  Flood the hell out of everything.  It's subtle (not attributable to terrorism), long lasting, and amazingly damaging for infrastructure and morale.  Art Bell would say that this kind of plot is plausable, as he has done expieriments with his radioshow listeners which caused a similar style of event in a drought area.  Cost: drums.  Training: just gather existing priests. 2. Hydrofluoric acid gas.  Getting the components nessicary for hydrofluoric acid is easy.  One way to get fluorine is by extraction from Teflon(TM) through burning.  Released into the atmosphere after being forced through a pool of boiling water would give you large quantities of hydrofluoric acid, a colorless gass which is very, very deadly, and can even dissolve glass.  This would kill millions in a nearly indetectible way.  Acid rain comprised primarily of hydrofluoric acid would have the subtle effect of preventing the use of several import metal ions in the body, including calcium.  This is most practical for installations/buildings with contained environmental systems, like high-rise buildings.  1 minute of 100 mg/cu. meter exposure is lethal, less material demands longer exposure, which should not be a problem in a corporate environment.  Dissolving glass is useful in, say, military installations where there are separate, isolated environmental systems.  Breaching of these systems is automatic with the acid.  (10-minute exposure of a 100m x 100m x 100m office building - 1 million cubic meters - would require around 10KG of material.) 3. EMPs.  Powerful and simple directional EMP devices can be built for around $100-150 USD a pop (thick copper wire, plastic drums, electrolyte, and various base metals).  They fit nicely into the back of even small pickup trucks (or old ones, so the cost of the transportation is cheap, too), and have a substantial range (a mile omnidirectional, ten in a directional cone, or more).  These can be used to thuroughly disable important infrastructure like power generation, water sanitation, and essential services like hospitals, police, and firefighters. The ultimate plan for terror and takeover would be a combination of several of these tactics - minus the rainmaker bit.  Take a reasonably trained militia in squads of point attack, EMP truck drivers, and snipers, say 10 squads with 6 members, 8 EMP teams of four members, and half a dozen to a dozen snipers totalling up to 104 members, and place them just outside critical installations prior to T-0. T-n, mine the roads of approach to the targets with spike strips and/or explosives to force approach on foot.  T-30 have the snipers set up and used as advanced scouts.  If there are protection measures in place (police at power generation facilities, for example), the snipers will eliminate them just as the EMP teams approach, T-2 or 3.  At T-0, the EMPs are set off to disable power relay or generation facilties and facilties which contain their own power generation capability (like hospitals).  As the power fails T+1, sweep in the teams to clean up police stations, fire stations, and hospitals, set charges, and run.  The 4-man EMP teams would then enter their targets, T+5 to 10, and simply eliminate everyone to prevent those infrastructures from returning to operation, then set charges, and run.  (The messier the power facility the better.  Nuclear is a major, major target, and if the target, the team should have enough expertise to simply set it to meltdown, rather than use their own explosives.)  Use the snipers to take out anyone approaching the original targets until T+120, pack up, and leave. I could imagine the above being used on the television show 24.  The most effective use would be to destroy the infrastructure of individual small towns at random across the US.  This would instill the maximum amount of fear, and if it is truly random, impossible to predict.

A 7/7 style multiprong attack, but on overground trains, on a slightly larger scale, but instead of using explosives, derail or sabotage trains manually.  There are 5-7 key stations which serve the whole of London, and the UK economy depends a lot on getting a very large number of workers into London along very narrow corridors.  Knock out those corridors for two-three days, and scare the commuters enough, you will break down the economy and the government in short order.  There is no infrastructure available to replace the rail links, no backup that I can imagine. Simply damaging the rails to throw trains off the bridges and entranceways to key stations should be enough to disrupt the system beyond repair for two to three days.  Blowing up the bridges, sabotaging the braking systems and releasing toxins in the carraiges will scare people away from the trains.  Some minor attacks on the underground system will be enough to scare people off that too.  The key to scaring people is to repeat the attacks in the following day or two - makes the police and government look powerless.  By hitting the weak points of the infrastructure outside of stations etc, you can fit this inside your budget & manpower requirements. I would say you only need to keep 60% of the commuters out of London for 3 days to bring down the government.

c61431,a000808,"This threat works on the premise that one pound of gasoline properly vaporised has the explosive power of roughly 1 pound of TNT. The attack uses a fully loaded gasoline tanker driven through a road tunnel under a city. The objective is to collapse the tunnel and bring down overhead buildings. Prior to the drive through a team disables the tunnel extractor fans to prevent dilution of the fuel air mix.
The team driving the tanker fit a high capacity pump with a spray head for efficient dispersal / evaporation. To lower the risk of premature ignition another team blocks the entrance(s) to the tunnel after the tanker enters. After an appropriate delay the tanker drives at a measured speed through the tunnel spraying the gasoline to achieve the best fuel/air mix. At the same time the tanker team drop multiple timer based igniter units set to flare at exactly the same time. To get more explosive power in a smaller space a second tanker containing LOX can drive through at the same time spraying liquid oxygen.  After completion of the run something like 80-100 tons of fuel and oxidiser is ready to explode in a few hundred yards of tunnel. The effect depends on the depth of the tunnel. If possible the tunnel is selected to be very shallow and located under vulnerable buildings. The effects of the attack are multiple 1. Tunnel is damaged / destroyed.
2. Overhead buildings are damaged / collapsed.
3. Some in-tunnel fatalities - not the primary objective.

c61524,a000808,"EMP has been mentioned several times, but I think this is new: Given that airplane-travel since 9/11 has been given so much scrutinity and ""safety enhancements"", a blow targeting commercial airtraffic would be highly effective psychologically, i.e. demoralizing. An EMP ""bomb"" is rather easy to build: several high-voltage capacitors, a battery and high-voltage power supply to keep them fully charged, some wiring, the coil and a timed trigger, amounting to a few kilos. Note that none of the components are on any aircraft security ""do-not-bring"" list. Also, no chemical substances are used that might be sniffed by bomb-squad dogs. The scenario goes: build a lot of these devices and sneak them aboard on a lot of airplanes nationwide at the same time. Have them go off at roughly the same time and watch those planes fall from the sky or at least experience severe technical troubles. For maximum effect plan the distribution and triggers so that several aircraft approaching the same airport at the same time are affected, thus maximizing the trouble on the ground. Imagine the tower having to watch several planes go down because all runways are full. And by distributing these incidents over a period of maybe one hour, media coverage and thus panic reactions can be maximized. And you don't even need suicide terrorists for it, AFAIK it is still possible to check in your suitcase and not go on board on inner-american flights. Such a suitcase will not be detected by explosive-sniffing dogs. X-ray might pose a problem, but it should be possible to camouflage the X-ray pictures. This is probably the weakest point. Alternatively, shipping electronic components via airfreight shouldn't arouse suspicion (no explosives!), so bringing down FedEx and UPS planes shouldn't be a problem. Note that EMP ""bombs"" probably won't bring down the airplanes at once. Airplanes have to withstand lightning bolts that carry much more zest, so the main components are hardened. This is even benefical threat-wise. There is a good chance that the airplane cannot continue its normal flight route and will declare emergency, requesting immediate landing. Given the timing, several airplanes will report emergencies at the same time in the same place, overloading the emergency-handling capabilities in towers, control centers and airports.",el Fisico,2006-05-24 08:31:00

Anyway, the church is something most people have an important relation with and it seems a large part of the US population frequently go to church. That means that there are regularly a large congregation of civilians in one spot and thus should be a nice terrorist target. Now assume the terrorists travel around in teams and randomly attack church buildings in different ways, defined by what would work for each particular church building: * Using (home-made) explosives to blow up the church during mass * Sniper attacks on people milling about outside after mass * Block doors and windows and set fire to wood/cloth if there's a lot of combustible material (do you have churches built out of wood?) * Block doors and windows and let in carbondioxide (from a couple of stolen trucks perhaps?) or other poisonous gas. Obviously the terrorists act as much as non-terrorists as they can to avoid suspicion, staying in place for quite a while (random lengths of time) before and after the actual attacks. Churches have traditionally been the place where you can always find haven. The result of the attacks will be that people feel insecure in the place where they should feel most secure and any security measures, ludicrous or not, will likely be accepted by the general public; * Church-goers must register with their ""home church"" * Visits to other churches must be approved in advance * Airport-like screening measures will be introduced * Church money will go to improved surveillance of both church interiors and the perimeter (because it will be required by federal law) instead of helping those in need * Confession will no longer be secret, law will mandate that the priest records confessions if required by law enforcement agencies Imagine the fear that would rise if this continues unstopped, a church full of people killed about once a month for several months - years! Oh, and to make it easier to point fingers in the wrong direction the terrorists might decide to blow up any type of church except, say, jewish churches. Wouldn't that give the nazi sympathizers a boost to their ranks if they were savvy enough to use the opportunity for propaganda? And unsavvy enough to not realize they were being used as decoys... By the way, the attacks would probably cause panic even if they only happened two or three times and the individual terrorist cells were caught immediately anyway. Oh yeah, the movie script based on this would of course include some really high-tech federal investigators using systems that can track every american everywhere, and finally that system  would be able to statistically figure out who these people are and where they are now so there can be a really tense last half hour of chasing dirty terrorists and ""disarming"" churches while mass is going on...

c62079,a000808,"[This is a treatment for a screenplay.  The working title is ""Vegetable Stand"".] It started at the supermarket in the New England suburb of Stepford.  A housewife in the produce section was blasted with pulp when a rutabaga exploded. Over the next few weeks, rutabagas blew up in supermarkets around the country.  There were no significant injuries, but plenty of messes.  Tabloids were full of stories about celebrities who'd been rutabagaed. At first, the whole thing was considered a prank, and was attributed to bored teenagers.  After all, what could be more natural than kids wanting to blow up vegetables?  The only serious effort to stop the trend was a public service campaign called ""This is Your Brain on Rutabagas.""  Nobody understood it, but at least late night TV talk shows had an abundance of material. Then everything changed.  A TV station in Seattle received a letter from a group that called itself the ""Rutabaga Liberation Army.""  On the envelope were strange markings that forensic scientists thought might be some foreign language.  America was under attack.  The public was horrified; their own vegetables were being used against them. A professor of rutabaga science conjectured that terrorists might be growing vegetables next to abandoned Cold War weapons plants.  The Department of Homeland Security assured everyone that rutabagas were harmless.  But to make sure, they requested a twenty-million-dollar grant from Congress to randomly test rutabagas for radiation.  A spokesman from DHS told the public that if they didn't continue eating rutabagas, the terrorists had won. Half of Congress gathered for a media event on the steps of the Capitol, to gobble what the Capitol cafeteria called ""Freedom Fruit.""  Patriotism was a shopping bag full of rutabagas. But not everyone was satisfied with the official line.  The country was polarized.  Half the population believed that rutabagas were a terrorist vegetable and refused to eat them.  The other half insisted that eating rutabagas was one way ordinary patriotic Americans could stand up to terrorism. Soaring demand caused a rutabaga shortage.  Several members of the Organization of Rutabaga-Exporting Countries talked about using rutabagas as an economic weapon against the United States.  Overnight, public sentiment turned against rutabagas. That's when the violence against rutabaga farmers began.  A dazed man fell from a truck and was found in the street by a mob, lying in what appeared to be a pile of rutabagas.  He was almost lynched before the cryptic vegetables were identified as turnips.  Farms known to produce rutabagas suffered arson at twice the rate of farms producing only turnips. Security companies that examined the belongings of people entering public buildings began to screen for rutabagas.  The Transportation Security Administration prohibited rutabagas on airplanes.  A woman was caught trying to smuggle one onto a plane.  She had disassembled it, cooked it, and hidden the parts in a vegetable stew.  A team in hazmat suits carried her lunch onto the tarmac and blew it up.  The White House Press Secretary exhibited satellite photographs of secret trailers full of rutabagas in Iran. Congress voted to spend three hundred million dollars for research on alternative vegetables.  Within a week of the first public service announcements urging everyone to support the Parsnip Movement, six parsnips detonated in supermarkets.  The American people were stunned.  Global warming and gay marriage were forgotten. Nobody had ever been brought to justice for the rutabaga attacks, and the public was enraged.  Congress passed the Killer Rutabagas And Parsnips Act, which created a federal agency with a four-billion-dollar budget.  Using recent discoveries in quantum gravitational theory, new vegetable detectors were developed and installed in airports.  Expenses were much larger than expected; the budget had to be doubled.  Other law enforcement programs were looted to supply the funds.  In the six months after passage of the KRAP Act, there were ten thousand more robberies than in a similar period a year earlier. Over time, the panic faded.  People forgot that rutabagas existed -- which in America, they didn't.  The War Against Vegetables appeared to be won. And then a shopper was pushing a cart full of groceries to her car when they were destroyed by an incendiary banana in one of the bags.  Exploding vegetables were one thing, but bananas were fruit.  This changed everything.  Again. Next came the broccoli bombs.  Desperation reigned.  Prisons could barely be built fast enough to house the burgeoning population of vegetable abusers.  And vegetable abuse was construed ever more broadly.  Anyone who had the nerve to point out that ""vegetable abuse"" was meaningless double-talk was suspected of being a vegetable sympathizer, and was spirited away to a secret prison. Nobody knew what might happen next.  People started eating snack cakes instead of fruits and vegetables.  To promote the illusion of a healthy diet, scientists at the Junk Food Institute developed a snack cake with a peel.  The cake failed commercially because of persistent rumors that it was made from petroleum byproducts.  Which it was.  With the rapid diet changes, America was overwhelmed by simultaneous obesity and malnutrition. American agriculture, its reputation demolished, could not compete in the world market.  The balance of payments deteriorated, petroleum became scarce, prices rose and buying power plummeted.   The American economy reeled.  Half the world suffered through a profound depression, and the global balance of power shuddered. And then the FBI announced they had discovered the perpetrators.  A group of teenagers around the country had carried out the vegetable attacks, using the Internet for coordination.  (The banana bombs had been copycat crimes by jealous adults.)  But the kids all insisted that some powerful and enigmatic entity was behind the attacks.  Finally, several informants independently named the Junk Food Institute.  The FBI was getting ready to raid the headquarters of the JFI when the investigation was abruptly abandoned, three days after the President's surprising re-election. Too much about the attacks was never explained.  One aspect in particular kept conspiracy theorists busy, although the President insisted it was mere coincidence:  He, the Chairman of the Junk Food Institute and the president of one of the largest manufacturers of voting machines were all classmates in college.  And all of them belonged to the most secret of secret societies -- the Benevolent Order of the Rutabaga.

c78494,a000808,"I really tried not to enter this contest, however my brain has not cooperated (I am sure it is a terrorist plot!) I break my terrorists into cells of 4-5 people.  The goal is to convince the American people to quit using all government services.  In so doing it would have a huge impact on the economy and the state of mind of the American people.  It would put incredible pressure on politicians to do something, it would dominate the news for as long as it continued. Each group selects a government building (i.e. post office, social security, VA hospital etc.)  The building is watched and a person is followed home (a mix of employees and regular citizens using the services).  This person is kidnapped and beheaded, the event is videotaped and posted on the net, various news agencies receive copies of the video.  The cell will claim that this person, an average American by using government services is supporting the oppression of good Muslims in the Far East.  The videotape should start with the person leaving a clearly identified government building. The demand is that the government should withdraw all soldiers from any location outside the US, and release all prisoners who are true brothers of Islam whether they are held in the US or outside of the US, regardless of the crime they are accused or guilty of.  The tapes can also respond to news coverage and other current events. The cell then packs up, moves to another city and repeats the process. The effect is to make everyone question their personal safety, and make it difficult for them to take advantage of the services they are entitled to.  It also isolates the Islamic community and subjects them to prejudice and (undeserved) ill treatment.  This can be used to help recruit the next round of terrorists. If one cell is captured, the next cell will claim that the people arrested are innocents who are being oppressed because the are Muslim, and that this killing demonstrates that they have the wrong people.  This introduces doubt that can be used by the defense to defend them (using the justice system against itself, and making convictions more difficult). One big advantage of this is that it is cheap, and the money will last a long time.

As for blowing up dams - The Brits (and a few Aussies) did this in WWII.  The final analysis was relatively little damage, although I recently read an interview with with a guard in a parpret on one of the dams - they were simply astonished.  
Out here in Australia, in Sydney the main water supply dam has about 18 months storage left, many others are nearly empty (some are), far from torrents running down gorges, there might be a dribble.
As for salmonella poisoning, a few years ago in Sydney, many, many people caught guiardia.  It got into the water supply because a Government policy was to aerial shoot feral animals in the water catchment areas - decomposing animals in the water supply - enough said.  However, the anti terrorist response to 9/11, was to install camoflauged wireless infra-red/night vision cameras around the dams - all this does is catch errant bushwalkers, cyclists and fishos.  Anyway we all survived the guiardia - it was a pain in the butt (sorry I couldn't avoid that one).

Take note of the different styles of towers in the row... if you pick the correct one, you can get several to domino at a time... once the primary lines hit the ground, you will overload and trip protective circuits on the generating end, and possibly cause blackouts, or brownouts if the feeder is small, on the receiving end All of this is low tech and boring... until it becomes random. At any rate, the disruption and fear will cause havoc in the energy distribution and supply markets...adding to the inflationary fears and market concerns. (5) Now that you have spooked everyone its time to take real action. Rail roads can be damaged sufficiently by messing with switches, using prybars to pull out a few specific spikes and unbolting a rail section or two.  If you derail a 2.5 mile long train of freight trailers along the interstate (where the train is running a max speed) you can be assured to disrupt rail traffic, and thus freight truck delivery traffic.  How often does Wal-Mart's just in time system make deliveries?  How many days supply do you have on hand at home? How much panic and market disruption would disruption to the food and critical markets cause? ON top of the fuel, natural gas, and power troubles now what would we have?  How long before the markets percieve (perception is always stronger than reality... and innumeracy is a disease.) a greater thread than terrorism?

The terrorists then deliver video recordings of their leader or known henchmen to Al-Jazeera claiming that ""the wrath of Allah"" will descend on the US and that the locations of the devastation have been marked with clocks.

People start discovering the boxes in their city with numbers ticking down from 48 hours.  The authorities try to surreptitiously remove them, but it's difficult to surreptitiously remove something 10-12 feet off the ground without ""someone"" noticing.

Huge government money and resources would be spent evacuating the sick and elderly.  The economy would be severely disrupted as millions stayed away from work.  Looting would be rampant.  Some politicians would urge caution, some would run off at the mouth.  Law and order would effectively break down. The boxes tick down to zero and... nothing happens. The terrorists can then release one of two pre-prepared tapes saying either A) There was a technical malfunction and it will all be triggered shortly  or B) The ""Wrath of Allah"" was the fear in the hearts of the infidels and the destruction they wrought upon themselves was brought about by Allah's will.

For the initial strike, I would propose planned positions on major roadway interchanges with high bridges. This allows the out of control trucks to fall off and make explosions suitable for an Arnold flick. From a practical standpoint, you will also damage the transportation infrastructure having an immediate economic impact. A burning load of petroleum can do great damage to reinforced concrete creating a transportation nightmare. Obviously, the more teams the better, but they would rove from one major city to another rather than staying put. If security tightens and operations get more difficult, the teams would continue to take out petroleum truck drivers in areas where there is less collateral damage potential. Quickly, the entire United States would grind to a halt from a combination of damaged infrastructure and drivers unwilling to get behind the wheel. I really do not think it would take that many teams to pull this off with a little planning.

So, I guess in my scenario there would be three airliners, probably cargo planes, since overpowering the crew would be easier and there would be no passengers to worry about. One plane would take off from George Bush Intercontinental and another from Houston William P. Hobby Airport.  The third aircraft would take off from Armstrong International in New Orleans, LA.  All three planes would be fueled for flights lasting at least six hours, in order to assure a large amount of kerosene fuel to add to the explosion.

c81258,a000808,"Bruce, Bruce, Bruce.......your winning entry is so implausible, I am surprised that you give it serious thought. First, it would be virtually impossible for attackers to take over two separate UPS terminals at two separate airports, AND KEEP THAT FACT A SECRET until the planes reached their destination.  Once somebody noticed what was going on, the plot would be foiled.  So that means capturing or killing every employee at each site quietly enough so as to not raise the alarm.  Airports are busy places especially the air cargo areas at night.  It would be virtually impossible for terrorists to secure these sites in secret. Second, air traffic controllers would certainly notice UPS aircraft taking off far ahead of their normal schedule.  If the attackers waited for the normal schedule, the risk of the plot being discovered would increase. Third, the plot requires the airliners to fly low enough to be below radar, but the terrain between the airports and the target is some of the most mountainous terrain in North America.  It would be virtually impossible for large jet aircraft traveling at high speed to hug the ground in such terrain at night. Finally, although it seems quite large, the Dam is quite a difficult target to hit with an aircraft traveling at nearly 200 mph (large jet aircraft can't fly much slower than that).  The World Trade Center towers were much easier to hit because they're so tall and visible from such a great distance on a clear sunny day.  While nearly a mile wide, the Grand Coulee Dam is only about 300 feet tall (above the water line).

There are security provisions which aren't and should not be public, but in general, our regional grid is perhaps the best engineered in the world, and even a massive failure at Grand Coulee would be isolated and ""islanded"" within less than a second.  There are always enough ""spinning reserves"" on the system to provide reliability throughout the grid.  This does not rule out an occasional cascading failure as occurred in 1995 when a tree limb shorted out a transmission line in central Oregon and did shut down much of the west coast for a brief period.  System outages occur daily -- see for example the logs at http://www.transmission.bpa.gov/orgs/opi/outages/DIR/TODAY.HTM.  Downstream dams have enough storage capacity to hold even a flood surge from Grand Coulee.

c106761,a000808,"The greatest terrorist threat of all is not an attack on our infrastructure, nor is it a direct attack on our economy. Rather, it is the deliberate, slow, long-term process of building a culture of fear in the populace. This idea has its roots in Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy and is Statist in nature. First, Aristotle, in his Politics I.2, asserts that human beings are by nature “political animals.��? If this is true than the State has god-like status and it is at liberty to use the populace however it wishes to accomplish its objectives – including killing them. Second, combine this with Plato’s concept of the “noble lie��? which gives the State the power to lie to populace whenever it is in the State’s best interest and you have a stage set for building a culture of fear. In such a culture the populace is more and more willing to give up its “rights��? so that it can be protected by the State (usually against a [at least partially] fictitious foe). Third, another ingredient which, when added to the mix, helps further this cause is an externally “religious��? ruler. Aristotle often would attend pagan services and make a great pretense of worshiping the Greek gods, not because he actually believed in them, but because it was to the State’s benefit for the people to be bound by religion thus keeping them from becoming anarchistic (i.e. they are easily controllable). Put all of theses together and you have the potential for perpetual terror inflicted by the State on its own people. Now that’s terrorism! The above is fictitiously spelled out in-detail by George Orwell is his novel 1984. In real-life many governments throughout history have used this tactic to keep its people in check. In our own time, this method was put into full swing by Leo Strauss, the father of the modern neo-conservative movement, a movement currently in power. The goal is sheer power, thus Orwell writes “If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face— forever.��? The American people as a whole have a hard time believing this is happening to them. Why? 1.	The people have no understanding of history. If they did they would see that governments have done this kind of thing throughout history. 
a.	This is intentional. The State run school system has reduced history to a set of meaningless and unrelated facts. Since globalism is the current goal, schools focus more on multiculturalism and tolerance than teaching the “who, what, when, where, how, and WHY��? of history.  2.	The populace has been largely dumbed down and is sinking further with every generation. This is related the first reason given above, but applies to all areas of education. It is also an intentional result of the State run public school system. The dumber the populace, the easier they are controlled. 3.	The populace has been infused with nationalist sentiments, “This is America, nothing like that can happen here!��? 
a.	The propaganda machine is in full swing and the dumbed down populace is ready to believe anything they are told. This is a page right out of 1984. The Ministry of Truth is busy pumping out lies:
i.	War is Peace
ii.	Freedom is Slavery
iii.	Ignorance is Strength     4.	The majority of the Christian populace has bought the Straussian lie of the political Right and it assumes that there is no way their “Christian��? President would ever be guilty of such atrocity (see my third point in the first paragraph). 
a.	However, it does not take much searching to show that his “Christianity��? is only a public show.  5.	Every time the populace begins to doubt, the government stages another “terror��? attack to keep the people in a culture of fear, thus propagating the noble lie. This is done in cooperation with the most of the Western governments to further the credibility of the lie (see point two in my first paragraph). 
a.	We have just been witness to this with the supposed terror attack in London which was just “thwarted��?.
b.	We also can see this in the report of the Hezbollah soldier who was recently captured. He happened to be one of the soldiers who was a member of the raiding party which captured the two Israeli soldiers (the original pretext for Israel invading Lebanon – never mind the fact that Israel has occupied Lebanon for nearly 25 years).

c119772,a000808,"While flying on American Airlines last week, I watched the flight attendant move a beverage cart into the middle of the walkway and wedge it in front of the bathroom near the cockpit as a barricade.  She then knocked on the cockpit door, a pilot came out and went to the bathroom.  After the pilot came out of the bathroom, he immediately knocked on the cockpit door, it opened, and he went back in. Strategy: For the attackers with first-class aisle seats in the front, the beverage cart being wedged into the walkway is the sign that the cockpit door will soon be opened.  When it is opened, have one man dive over the beverage cart and scramble to put his body into the cockpit doorway to keep it open, have another couple guys jump over the cart and get into the cockpit with knives hidden in the opaque-to-x-ray batteries of their laptops, etc. (or with their hair gel containers and nail clippers). A variation of this is to watch the light coming through the spyhole in the cockpit door: when it goes dark, a pilot is looking through it to check out the walkway, most likely because he's about to open the door to go to the bathroom.  This gives time for the attackers to prepare while the attendant moves the beverage cart, or, if the cart trick wont be used at all, to get ready to rush the door upon opening. Because it is unlikely that the pilot coming out of the bathroom will wait a random amount of time before going back into the cockpit, his emerging from the bathroom could also be used as the signal to rush the front, since he will likely just immediately knock on the cockpit door.  But this isn't as effective of course (if only because the recently-pottied pilot is now in the open and able to fight instead of being indisposed in the commode, which, by the way, could be held shut by an attacker as a simple way to neutralize that pilot when the fight starts). The beverage cart is intended to be a barrier, but it is much more useful to the attackers as a signal that the door will soon be opened.  It would be better if the pilot just quickly opened the cockpit door at an unpredictable time, locked it behind him, helped to move the beverage cart into barrier position, pottied while the flight attendant braced the cart and watched for rushers, pilot emerges and waits a random amount of time (30 seconds to 3 minutes) then regains access to cockpit again after confirming no attack.  Assuming a little piece of plastic is always hung over the spyhole inside the cockpit to block light, the pilot could put his eye up to the spyhole, move the plastic aside to see into the walkway while continuing to block light with his head, then the pilot could view the walkway before opening the door without signalling with the light that he was about to do so.",SANSy-44771,2006-10-18 08:52:00
c119952,a000808,"I came to know about this contest very late and am not sure if it is still on. Nevertheless here is my plot.
1>	Terrorists mark a train, which is ever populated and is on a somewhat long route.
2>	Then they select a place in a very rural and unpopulated area where the train line is below a sort of over bridge or is surrounded by a highland.
3>	One of them board the train with a silenced gun, while the train is descending towards the marked place, he makes his way through the train into its engine and kills the driver. He then takes over the train.
4>	 He eliminates the brakes of the train. 
5>	In the meantime his friends bring in tankers (4 or more) filled with petrol, at the chosen place. 
6>	As the train passes the place, the new driver slows down the train but still keeps it moving. His allies outside begin to shower huge quantity of petrol on the train.
7>	Once the train is drenched in petrol, a terrorist sets it into flames via grenade. This the time when the one within, acting as the driver accelerates the train.
8>	Thus the train is now a burning train. Before anyone would realise what has happened thousands would already be burnt alive.
9>	This will create fear in the minds of people who are already afraid of aeroplanes. After this they will be afraid of even travelling by train          This is not entirely fictious, a smaller incident has already happened in 
Godhra, Gujarat in 2002 when a mob of over a thousand Muslims surrounded the Sabarmati express, locked the doors of S6 bogies, which was carrying Hindu activists. They then bombarded the coach with stones and then finally set it on flames. 51 people were burnt alive; this is what led to Gujarat riots of 2002. 
	The plot that I have suggested is just a zoomed picture of the tragic incident that had taken place in Godhra. There only one compartment was set on fire, here I have extended it for the whole train. This will high impact on the Americans who are already very afraid of boarding a flight   ",navin,2006-10-18 20:15:00

Special camera time is spent on the absence of miles of electrified fencing and the absence of border patrol guards.  (One of the ""Minutemen"" spots them and calls in border patrol.  They arrive 3 hours too late.) Scene 2: The illegal immigrants get hired by companies either by using badly forged paper-work.  (Cue scene with them gloating over the lack of REAL ID that allows them to so easily get away with it.) Scene 3: After working in these companies and gaining a large group of people that will all claim ""He was always so quiet.  How could he ever do such a thing?"" when the time comes, their corporate health-insurance becomes valid.  They all go out to get eye exams. Scene 4: Cut to scene with illegal immigrants tampering with and forging their lens prescriptions.  (Of course, the lack of proper security paper helps this.)  Careful work with college optics text-books allow them to carefully craft the exact prescriptions that they need. Scene 5: Each terrorist goes out to their local electronics store and purchases a portable DVD player. Scene 6: Airport security (finally!) 30 illegal immigrants with forged identification go through security with coke-bottle glasses and portable DVD players.  Their shoes are carefully inspected to ensure that they aren't explosive.  They get through with no problems and board 3 different airplanes (10 per plane) Scene 7: On each plane, the terrorists wait until they are at cruising altitude and then disassemble the DVD players to get at the lasers.  They focus them using the glasses to blind the various flight attendants.  When the co-pilot goes to look through the cockpit door viewport, they blind him as well. Scene 8: All of the 10 lasers are focused together (using the glasses) to create a beam strong enough to cut through the cockpit door.  Once inside, they blind the pilot and hijack the plane. Scene 9: The terrorists all crash their planes into border-patrol headquarters to make it easier for their brethren to sneak in. Few final notes:  
Cost is ($100 (DVD player) + $1000 (Human Smuggler) + $300 (plane ticket)) * 30 (people) = $42,000
DVD player lasers output around 5-10mw (sufficient for eye damage) so if you get your lenses right, 100mw (10 of them) is sufficient to cut through things.

or
Overiding the airplanes GPS information through a distrbuted Nintendo DS network using the Motorola chipset and TDMA protocol to exploit the ADS-B system.   The scenario: 
Terrorist hire electronics engineers to study the relationship between the Nintendo DS', Motorola chipset, and the ADS-B technology used to broadcast aircraft positions.  They purchase a small aircraft containing an ADS-B system and 5 Nintendo DS units.  After 17 months of work they finally find an exploitable correlation in the TDMA protocol that allows the Nintendo to run homebrew code that can spoof the ADS-B information being brodcast.  The homebrew code is then loaded into 30 ""special"" Nintendo DS systems and distributed out to the terrorist network.  After several more months these systems finally arrive in the hands of the terrorist who then distribute the systems free of charge to unsuspecting passengers.  The systems, now having been synchronized with each passengers flight information, just need to be activated.  As long as the Nintendo DS is turned on within 50 feet of the ADS-B equipment on board the plane, it will  hijack the aircrafts own ADS-B signal being broadcast, replacing the true signal information with information that will eventually lead to the collision of 15 planes with 15 other planes.  The tainted Nintedo DS units are all activated within 15 minutes of each flight, all 30 Nintendo's begin running the prepopulated exploit code, spoofing the information to the ADS-B system.  The estatic recipients of the ""awards"" are blissfully unaware that each Mario jump, each Kirby punch, each pet of their Nintendog is leading their very flight on a ride to disaster.  As the Nintendo DS transmitter, being capable of sending proprietary TDMA information using the Motorola based chipset silently works as programmed in 80% of the cases, causing a mid-air collision of 24 planes almost simultaneously so there is no chance to respond, react or recall the aircraft.  Once again air travel in the United States takes a huge blow, with massive disruptions to the economy and investigators are puzzled for months until they figure out what caused the disasters.  Then to the great ire of Nintendo fanboys everywhere, the TSA issues the ban on all Nintendo handheld gaming devices, until the problem can be studied further.  This action in turn results in even larger financial burdens on the already cash strapped airlines as 10's of thousands of distraught parents refuse to fly anymore as their children have nothing to do on the airplane.  Amtrak's business increases marginally.  Nintendo releases a patch for the DS one month later.   External resources supporting plausibility:  Motorola provides support for Nintendo

Once you've planted the bombs on all the buses or are out of bombs leave and simultaneously detonate at peak hour initial losses are all those on the buses plus the vehicles and shops surrounding the blast knock on effects is fear of use of public transportation or maybe even the roads wreckage on roads stops important shipments, delivery's motorcades ect.",Hugh,2007-10-25 02:49:00

c304709,a000808,"The goal of terror is to be ubiquitous and remind the targets that no place is safe. No significant body count is required usually. Step 1: Prepare a number of small timed devices for placement in shopping malls, stores, etc. At the designated hour, it releases a mist or fine powder with some harmless but memorable scent, and begins playing an audio recording... ""Nerve gas, anthrax, RUN!"" There will be enough trampling victims to keep first responders and HAZMAT busy for hours. Step 2: That same night, presuming the authorities haven't yet ascertained that no deaths were caused by bio/chem agents, introduce the same scent into the natural gas supply. Then call the local TV stations to make sure it gets wide coverage. Message: We can get to you anywhere.",Psychic Warrior,2008-09-07 09:04:00
c365190,a000808,"Multi-ethnic squads of Iranian, Iraqi, Somali, Afghan, Saudi, Serbian, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Chilean, Cuban, Nicaraguan, Panamanian and Grenadan terrorists disguised as former Nazis goose-step across our borders and mass near the wood scrap bins at Home Depots across the country. Their nefarious plot: the clandestine construction and deployment of Particle Board Weapons from sea to shining sea. Their evil puppetmasters: the Obscurati, a shadowy combine of Chinese Triads, Manichaean Dyads and Leibnitzian Monads bent on holding the entire U.S. hostage for a ransom of ONE MILLION DOLLARS. Their nemesis: hard-bitten data miner Jean Rimbaud of the HSNMD (Homeland Security Netflix Monitoring Division). Their only weakness: a penchant for Busby Berkeley films. Will Agent Rimbaud successfully collect, sort, collate, index and cross-reference mountains of data on film rentals by organizations as diverse as the BCAT (Bund Cake Appreciation Trust) and LWA (Lambeth Walker Associates) in time to finger the conspirators? Will Rimbaud's PC have enough storage to hold all the Echelon intercepts he needs to track them down? Will America's strategic reserve of wood scraps run dangerously low? In theaters this summer.

c365199,a000808,"Terrorists hide an incendiary bomb under the Capitol. Their threat: to detonate the bomb while Congress is in session, utterly destroying the Capitol with a massive fool-air mixture explosion. America's only hope: a round-the-clock, week-long telethon that must raise enough money to put the terrorists into comfortable retirement in the Witness Protection Program. Will the Federal Reserve be able to print enough stimulus money and distribute it in time for the telethon to recapture it for the terrorists? Will a week-long telethon with no commercial breaks finally break the back of compassion-fatigued America? Will the Capitol's bathrooms handle the strain of an entire week of captive congressional productivity? Would we be better off with a new Congress anyway? Don't miss the astonishing, focus group-guided climax! In theaters soon!

c542733,a000808,"Here is an idea that would cause mass panic.
Take your 30 terrorists. Each of them buys a car (pick the car that no-one is going to notice and that the cops wont pull over or care about)  Each terrorist then fills all the non-visible spaces in the car (boot etc) with explosives. At a pre-determined time, the terrorists all drive to a specific gas station and set off the bombs in such a way as to cause a fire/explosion in the underground gasoline tanks.
Gas stations would be picked to cover all parts of the nation as well as all different brands.  Messages are left claiming that there are another 30 terrorists waiting to repeat the excercise. Would cause immediate loss of life of people at the gas station as well as damage to the gas stations and any surrounding buildings due to the fire and explosion. Plus it would cause economic pain as people become afraid to go to the gas station (and hence afraid to drive due to the risks of not having enough fuel). Plus there are so many gas stations that securing them all with guards and inspection of cars before they pull in would be impossible (and expensive/inconvenient). Plus, as an added bonus, the next guy that tries to rob the local gas station gets shot by the federally mandated security force guarding against terrorist bombs.
